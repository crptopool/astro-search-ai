**1.** (1) K?f, H?, Y?, ?Ayn, ??d.[806]

**2.** (2) [This is] a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah

**3.** (3) When he called to his Lord a private call [i.e., supplication].

**4.** (4) He said, "My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has filled[807] with white, and never have I been in my supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy [i.e., disappointed].

**5.** (5) And indeed, I fear the successors[808] after me, and my wife has been barren, so give me from Yourself an heir

**6.** (6) Who will inherit me[809] and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You]."

**7.** (7) [He was told],[810] "O Zechariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be John. We have not assigned to any before [this] name."

**8.** (8) He said, "My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has been barren and I have reached extreme old age?"

**9.** (9) [An angel] said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, for I created you before, while you were nothing.'"

**10.** (10) [Zechariah] said, "My Lord, make for me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights, [being] sound."[811]

**11.** (11) So he came out to his people from the prayer chamber and signaled to them to exalt [All?h] in the morning and afternoon.

**12.** (12) [All?h said], "O John, take the Scripture [i.e., adhere to it] with determination." And We gave him judgement [while yet] a boy

**13.** (13) And affection from Us and purity, and he was fearing of All?h

**14.** (14) And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant.

**15.** (15) And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.

**16.** (16) And mention, [O Mu?ammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east.

**17.** (17) And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our Angel [i.e., Gabriel], and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.

**18.** (18) She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of All?h."

**19.** (19) He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy [i.e., son]."

**20.** (20) She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?"

**21.** (21) He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'"

**22.** (22) So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.

**23.** (23) And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, "Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."

**24.** (24) But he[812] called her from below her, "Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.

**25.** (25) And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.

**26.** (26) So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.'"

**27.** (27) Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, "O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.

**28.** (28) O sister [i.e., descendant] of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."

**29.** (29) So she pointed to him. They said, "How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?"

**30.** (30) [Jesus] said, "Indeed, I am the servant of All?h. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.

**31.** (31) And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zak?h as long as I remain alive

**32.** (32) And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.

**33.** (33) And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive."

**34.** (34) That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.

**35.** (35) It is not [befitting] for All?h to take a son; exalted is He![813] When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, "Be," and it is.

**36.** (36) [Jesus said], "And indeed, All?h is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path."

**37.** (37) Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.

**38.** (38) How [clearly] they will hear and see the Day they come to Us, but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.

**39.** (39) And warn them, [O Mu?ammad], of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded;[814] and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.

**40.** (40) Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.

**41.** (41) And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.

**42.** (42) [Mention] when he said to his father, "O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?

**43.** (43) O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.

**44.** (44) O my father, do not worship [i.e., obey] Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.

**45.** (45) O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire]."

**46.** (46) [His father] said, "Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time."

**47.** (47) [Abraham] said, "Peace [i.e., safety] will be upon you.[815] I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.

**48.** (48) And I will leave you and those you invoke other than All?h and will invoke[816] my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy [i.e., disappointed]."

**49.** (49) So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than All?h, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.

**50.** (50) And We gave them of Our mercy, and We made for them a mention [i.e., reputation] of high honor.

**51.** (51) And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet.[817]

**52.** (52) And We called him from the side of the mount[818] at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him].

**53.** (53) And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.

**54.** (54) And mention in the Book, Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet.

**55.** (55) And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zak?h and was to his Lord pleasing [i.e., accepted by Him].

**56.** (56) And mention in the Book, Idrees. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.

**57.** (57) And We raised him to a high station.

**58.** (58) Those were the ones upon whom All?h bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel [i.e., Jacob], and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.

**59.** (59) But there came after them successors [i.e., later generations] who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil[819] -

**60.** (60) Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.

**61.** (61) [Therein are] gardens of perpetual residence which the Most Merciful has promised His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise has ever been eminent.[820]

**62.** (62) They will not hear therein any ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and they will have their provision therein, morning and afternoon.

**63.** (63) That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our servants who were fearing of All?h.

**64.** (64) [Gabriel said],[821] "And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful -

**65.** (65) Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?"

**66.** (66) And man [i.e., the disbeliever] says, "When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?"

**67.** (67) Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?

**68.** (68) So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.[822]

**69.** (69) Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.

**70.** (70) Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.

**71.** (71) And there is none of you except he will come to it.[823] This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.

**72.** (72) Then We will save those who feared All?h and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.

**73.** (73) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?"[824]

**74.** (74) And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?

**75.** (75) Say, "Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers."

**76.** (76) And All?h increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord[825] for reward and better for recourse.

**77.** (77) Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, "I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]"?

**78.** (78) Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?

**79.** (79) No! We will record what he says and extend [i.e., increase] for him from the punishment extensively.

**80.** (80) And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions,[826] and he will come to Us alone.

**81.** (81) And they have taken besides All?h [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.

**82.** (82) No! They [i.e., those "gods"] will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].

**83.** (83) Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them [to evil] with [constant] incitement?

**84.** (84) So be not impatient over them. We only count out [i.e., allow] to them a [limited] number.[827]

**85.** (85) On the Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation

**86.** (86) And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst

**87.** (87) None will have [power of] intercession except he who had taken from the Most Merciful a covenant.[828]

**88.** (88) And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son."

**89.** (89) You have done an atrocious thing.

**90.** (90) The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation

**91.** (91) That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.

**92.** (92) And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.

**93.** (93) There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.

**94.** (94) He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.

**95.** (95) And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.

**96.** (96) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.[829]

**97.** (97) So, [O Mu?ammad], We have only made it [i.e., the Qur�?n] easy in your tongue [i.e., the Arabic language] that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people.

**98.** (98) And how many have We destroyed before them of generations? Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?
