description: Translation of Surah 90 - The City (Al-Balad)
---

**1.** (1) I swear by this city [i.e., Makkah] �

**2.** (2) And you, [O Mu?ammad], are free of restriction in this city �

**3.** (3) And [by] the father[1924] and that which was born [of him],

**4.** (4) We have certainly created man into hardship.

**5.** (5) Does he think that never will anyone overcome him?

**6.** (6) He says, "I have spent wealth in abundance."

**7.** (7) Does he think that no one has seen him?

**8.** (8) Have We not made for him two eyes?

**9.** (9) And a tongue and two lips?

**10.** (10) And have shown him the two ways?[1925]

**11.** (11) But he has not broken through the difficult pass.[1926]

**12.** (12) And what can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass?

**13.** (13) It is the freeing of a slave

**14.** (14) Or feeding on a day of severe hunger

**15.** (15) An orphan of near relationship

**16.** (16) Or a needy person in misery

**17.** (17) And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion.

**18.** (18) Those are the companions of the right.[1927]

**19.** (19) But they who disbelieved in Our signs - those are the companions of the left.[1928]

**20.** (20) Over them will be fire closed in.[1929]
