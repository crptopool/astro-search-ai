description: Translation of Surah 69 - The Reality (Al-Haqqah)
---

**1.** (1) The Inevitable Reality -

**2.** (2) What is the Inevitable Reality?

**3.** (3) And what can make you know what is the Inevitable Reality?

**4.** (4) Tham?d and ?Aad denied the Striking Calamity [i.e., the Resurrection].

**5.** (5) So as for Tham?d, they were destroyed by the overpowering [blast].

**6.** (6) And as for ?Aad, they were destroyed by a screaming,[1737] violent wind

**7.** (7) Which He [i.e., All?h] imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees.

**8.** (8) Then do you see of them any remains?

**9.** (9) And there came Pharaoh and those before him and the overturned cities[1738] with sin.

**10.** (10) And they disobeyed the messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with a seizure exceeding [in severity].

**11.** (11) Indeed, when the water overflowed, We carried you [i.e., your ancestors] in the sailing ship[1739]

**12.** (12) That We might make it for you a reminder and [that] a conscious ear would be conscious of it.

**13.** (13) Then when the Horn is blown with one blast

**14.** (14) And the earth and the mountains are lifted and leveled with one blow [i.e., stroke] -

**15.** (15) Then on that Day, the Occurrence [i.e., Resurrection] will occur,

**16.** (16) And the heaven will split [open], for that Day it is infirm.[1740]

**17.** (17) And the angels are at its edges. And there will bear the Throne of your Lord above them, that Day, eight [of them].

**18.** (18) That Day, you will be exhibited [for judgement]; not hidden among you is anything concealed.[1741]

**19.** (19) So as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, "Here, read my record!

**20.** (20) Indeed, I was certain that I would be meeting my account."

**21.** (21) So he will be in a pleasant life -

**22.** (22) In an elevated garden,

**23.** (23) Its [fruit] to be picked hanging near.

**24.** (24) [They will be told], "Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth[1742] in the days past."

**25.** (25) But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, "Oh, I wish I had not been given my record

**26.** (26) And had not known what is my account.

**27.** (27) I wish it [i.e., my death] had been the decisive one.[1743]

**28.** (28) My wealth has not availed me.

**29.** (29) Gone from me is my authority."[1744]

**30.** (30) [All?h will say], "Seize him and shackle him.

**31.** (31) Then into Hellfire drive him.

**32.** (32) Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits insert him."

**33.** (33) Indeed, he did not used to believe in All?h, the Most Great,

**34.** (34) Nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor.

**35.** (35) So there is not for him here this Day any devoted friend

**36.** (36) Nor any food except from the discharge of wounds;

**37.** (37) None will eat it except the sinners.

**38.** (38) So I swear by what you see

**39.** (39) And what you do not see

**40.** (40) [That] indeed, it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is the word of a noble Messenger.

**41.** (41) And it is not the word of a poet; little do you believe.

**42.** (42) Nor the word of a soothsayer; little do you remember.

**43.** (43) [It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.

**44.** (44) And if he [i.e., Mu?ammad] had made up about Us some [false] sayings,

**45.** (45) We would have seized him by the right hand;[1745]

**46.** (46) Then We would have cut from him the aorta.[1746]

**47.** (47) And there is no one of you who could prevent [Us] from him.

**48.** (48) And indeed, it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is a reminder for the righteous.

**49.** (49) And indeed, We know that among you are deniers.

**50.** (50) And indeed, it will be [a cause of] regret upon the disbelievers.

**51.** (51) And indeed, it is the truth of certainty.

**52.** (52) So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great.
