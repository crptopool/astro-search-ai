**1.** (1) By the sun and its brightness

**2.** (2) And [by] the moon when it follows it

**3.** (3) And [by] the day when it displays it[1931]

**4.** (4) And [by] the night when it covers [i.e., conceals] it

**5.** (5) And [by] the sky and He who constructed it

**6.** (6) And [by] the earth and He who spread it

**7.** (7) And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it[1932]

**8.** (8) And inspired it [with discernment of] its wickedness and its righteousness,

**9.** (9) He has succeeded who purifies it,

**10.** (10) And he has failed who instills it [with corruption].

**11.** (11) Tham?d denied [their prophet] by reason of their transgression,

**12.** (12) When the most wretched of them was sent forth.[1933]

**13.** (13) And the messenger of All?h [i.e., ??li?] said to them, "[Do not harm] the she-camel of All?h or [prevent her from] her drink."

**15.** (15) And He does not fear the consequence thereof.[1935]
