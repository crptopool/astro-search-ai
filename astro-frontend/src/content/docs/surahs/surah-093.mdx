**1.** (1) By the morning brightness

**2.** (2) And [by] the night when it covers with darkness,[1941]

**3.** (3) Your Lord has not taken leave of you, [O Mu?ammad], nor has He detested [you].

**4.** (4) And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life].

**5.** (5) And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.

**6.** (6) Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?

**7.** (7) And He found you lost and guided [you],

**8.** (8) And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient.

**9.** (9) So as for the orphan, do not oppress [him].

**10.** (10) And as for the petitioner,[1942] do not repel [him].

**11.** (11) But as for the favor of your Lord, report [it].
