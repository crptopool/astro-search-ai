description: Translation of Surah 92 - The Night (Al-Layl)
---

**1.** (1) By the night when it covers[1937]

**2.** (2) And [by] the day when it appears

**3.** (3) And [by] He who created the male and female,

**4.** (4) Indeed, your efforts are diverse.

**5.** (5) As for he who gives and fears All?h

**6.** (6) And believes in the best [reward].

**7.** (7) We will ease him toward ease.

**8.** (8) But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need

**9.** (9) And denies the best [reward],

**10.** (10) We will ease him toward difficulty.

**11.** (11) And what will his wealth avail him when he falls?[1938]

**12.** (12) Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.

**13.** (13) And indeed, to us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life].

**14.** (14) So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing.

**15.** (15) None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one

**16.** (16) Who had denied and turned away.

**17.** (17) But the righteous one will avoid it �

**18.** (18) [He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself

**19.** (19) And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded[1939] �

**20.** (20) But only seeking the face [i.e., acceptance] of his Lord, Most High.

**21.** (21) And he is going to be satisfied.
