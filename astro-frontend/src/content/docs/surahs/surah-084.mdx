description: Translation of Surah 84 - The Sundering (Al-Inshiqaq)
---

**1.** (1) When the sky has split [open]

**2.** (2) And has listened [i.e., responded][1888] to its Lord and was obligated [to do so]

**3.** (3) And when the earth has been extended[1889]

**4.** (4) And has cast out that within it[1890] and relinquished [it]

**5.** (5) And has listened [i.e., responded] to its Lord and was obligated [to do so] �

**6.** (6) O mankind, indeed you are laboring toward your Lord with [great] exertion[1891] and will meet it.[1892]

**7.** (7) Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand,

**8.** (8) He will be judged with an easy account

**9.** (9) And return to his people in happiness.

**10.** (10) But as for he who is given his record behind his back,

**11.** (11) He will cry out for destruction

**12.** (12) And [enter to] burn in a Blaze.

**13.** (13) Indeed, he had [once] been among his people in happiness;

**14.** (14) Indeed, he had thought he would never return [to All?h].

**15.** (15) But yes! Indeed, his Lord was ever, of him, Seeing.

**16.** (16) So I swear by the twilight glow

**17.** (17) And [by] the night and what it envelops

**18.** (18) And [by] the moon when it becomes full

**19.** (19) [That] you will surely embark upon [i.e., experience] state after state.[1893]

**20.** (20) So what is [the matter] with them [that] they do not believe,

**21.** (21) And when the Qur�?n is recited to them, they do not prostrate [to All?h]?

**22.** (22) But those who have disbelieved deny,

**23.** (23) And All?h is most knowing of what they keep within themselves.

**24.** (24) So give them tidings of a painful punishment,

**25.** (25) Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them is a reward uninterrupted.
