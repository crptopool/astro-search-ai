description: Translation of Surah 76 - The Man (Al-Insan)
---

**1.** (1) Has there [not] come upon man a period of time when he was not a thing [even] mentioned?

**2.** (2) Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture[1811] that We may try him; and We made him hearing and seeing.

**3.** (3) Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful.

**4.** (4) Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze.

**5.** (5) Indeed, the righteous will drink from a cup [of wine] whose mixture is of K?f?r,[1812]

**6.** (6) A spring of which the [righteous] servants of All?h will drink; they will make it gush forth in force [and abundance].

**7.** (7) They [are those who] fulfill [their] vows and fear a Day whose evil will be widespread.

**8.** (8) And they give food in spite of love for it[1813] to the needy, the orphan, and the captive,

**9.** (9) [Saying], "We feed you only for the face [i.e., approval] of All?h. We wish not from you reward or gratitude.

**10.** (10) Indeed, We fear from our Lord a Day austere and distressful."

**11.** (11) So All?h will protect them from the evil of that Day and give them radiance and happiness

**12.** (12) And will reward them for what they patiently endured [with] a garden [in Paradise] and silk [garments].

**13.** (13) [They will be] reclining therein on adorned couches. They will not see therein any [burning] sun or [freezing] cold.

**14.** (14) And near above them are its shades, and its [fruit] to be picked will be lowered in compliance.

**15.** (15) And there will be circulated among them vessels of silver and cups having been [created] clear [as glass],

**16.** (16) Clear glasses [made] from silver of which they have determined the measure.

**17.** (17) And they will be given to drink a cup [of wine] whose mixture is of ginger

**18.** (18) [From] a fountain within it [i.e., Paradise] named Salsabeel.

**19.** (19) There will circulate among them young boys made eternal. When you see them, you would think them [as beautiful as] scattered pearls.

**20.** (20) And when you look there [in Paradise], you will see pleasure and great dominion.

**21.** (21) Upon them [i.e., the inhabitants] will be green garments of fine silk and brocade. And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a purifying drink.

**22.** (22) [And it will be said], "Indeed, this is for you a reward, and your effort has been appreciated."

**23.** (23) Indeed, it is We who have sent down to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Qurï¿½?n progressively.

**24.** (24) So be patient for the decision of your Lord and do not obey from among them a sinner or ungrateful [disbeliever].

**25.** (25) And mention the name of your Lord [in prayer] morning and evening

**26.** (26) And during the night prostrate to Him and exalt [i.e., praise] Him a long [part of the] night.

**27.** (27) Indeed, these [disbelievers] love the immediate and leave behind them[1814] a grave Day.

**28.** (28) We have created them and strengthened their forms, and when We will, We can change their likenesses with [complete] alteration.

**29.** (29) Indeed, this is a reminder, so he who wills may take to his Lord a way.

**30.** (30) And you do not will except that All?h wills. Indeed, All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.

**31.** (31) He admits whom He wills into His mercy; but the wrongdoers - He has prepared for them a painful punishment.
