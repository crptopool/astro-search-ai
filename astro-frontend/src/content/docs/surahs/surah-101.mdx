**1.** (1) The Striking Calamity -

**2.** (2) What is the Striking Calamity?

**3.** (3) And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity?

**4.** (4) It is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed,[1975]

**5.** (5) And the mountains will be like wool, fluffed up.[1976]

**6.** (6) Then as for one whose scales are heavy [with good deeds],

**7.** (7) He will be in a pleasant life.

**8.** (8) But as for one whose scales are light,

**9.** (9) His refuge[1977] will be an abyss.[1978]

**10.** (10) And what can make you know what that is?

**11.** (11) It is a Fire, intensely hot.
