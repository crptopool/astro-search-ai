description: Translation of Surah 87 - The Most High (Al-A'la)
---

**1.** (1) Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most High,

**2.** (2) Who created and proportioned

**3.** (3) And who destined and [then] guided

**4.** (4) And who brings out the pasture

**5.** (5) And [then] makes it black stubble.

**6.** (6) We will make you recite, [O Mu?ammad], and you will not forget,

**7.** (7) Except what All?h should will. Indeed, He knows what is declared and what is hidden.

**8.** (8) And We will ease you toward ease.[1907]

**9.** (9) So remind, if the reminder should benefit;[1908]

**10.** (10) He who fears [All?h] will be reminded.

**11.** (11) But the wretched one will avoid it ï¿½

**12.** (12) [He] who will [enter and] burn in the greatest Fire,

**13.** (13) Neither dying therein nor living.

**14.** (14) He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself

**15.** (15) And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.

**16.** (16) But you prefer the worldly life,

**17.** (17) While the Hereafter is better and more enduring.

**18.** (18) Indeed, this is in the former scriptures,

**19.** (19) The scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
