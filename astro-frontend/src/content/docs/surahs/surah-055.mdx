**10.** (10) And the earth He laid [out] for the creatures.

**11.** (11) Therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths [of dates]

**12.** (12) And grain having husks and scented plants.

**13.** (13) So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?[1594]

**14.** (14) He created man from clay like [that of] pottery.

**15.** (15) And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire.

**44.** (44) They will circulate between it and scalding water, heated [to the utmost degree].

**45.** (45) So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
