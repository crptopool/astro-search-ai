description: Translation of Surah 54 - The Moon (Al-Qamar)
---

**1.** (1) The Hour has come near, and the moon has split [in two].[1577]

**2.** (2) And if they see a sign [i.e., miracle], they turn away and say, "Passing magic."[1578]

**3.** (3) And they denied and followed their inclinations. But for every matter is a [time of] settlement.

**4.** (4) And there has already come to them of information that in which there is deterrence.

**5.** (5) Extensive wisdom - but warning does not avail [them].

**6.** (6) So leave them, [O Mu?ammad]. The Day the Caller[1579] calls to something forbidding,

**7.** (7) Their eyes humbled, they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts spreading,

**8.** (8) Racing ahead toward the Caller. The disbelievers will say, "This is a difficult Day."

**9.** (9) The people of Noah denied before them, and they denied Our servant and said, "A madman," and he was repelled.

**10.** (10) So he invoked his Lord, "Indeed, I am overpowered, so help."

**11.** (11) Then We opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down

**12.** (12) And caused the earth to burst with springs, and the waters met for a matter already predestined.

**13.** (13) And We carried him on a [construction of] planks and nails,

**14.** (14) Sailing under Our observation as reward for he who had been denied.

**15.** (15) And We left it as a sign, so is there any who will remember?

**16.** (16) And how [severe] were My punishment and warning.[1580]

**17.** (17) And We have certainly made the Qur�?n easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

**18.** (18) ?Aad denied; and how [severe] were My punishment and warning.

**19.** (19) Indeed, We sent upon them a screaming wind on a day of continuous misfortune,

**20.** (20) Extracting the people[1581] as if they were trunks of palm trees uprooted.

**21.** (21) And how [severe] were My punishment and warning.

**22.** (22) And We have certainly made the Qur�?n easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

**23.** (23) Tham?d denied the warning.

**24.** (24) And said, "Is it one human being[1582] among us that we should follow? Indeed, we would then be in error and madness.

**25.** (25) Has the message been sent down upon him from among us? Rather, he is an insolent liar."

**26.** (26) They will know tomorrow who is the insolent liar.

**27.** (27) Indeed, We are sending the she-camel as trial for them, so watch them and be patient.[1583]

**28.** (28) And inform them that the water is shared between them,[1584] each [day of] drink attended [by turn].

**29.** (29) But they called their companion,[1585] and he dared[1586] and hamstrung [her].

**30.** (30) And how [severe] were My punishment and warning.

**31.** (31) Indeed, We sent upon them one shriek [i.e., blast from the sky], and they became like the dry twig fragments of an [animal] pen.

**32.** (32) And We have certainly made the Qur�?n easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

**33.** (33) The people of Lot denied the warning.

**34.** (34) Indeed, We sent upon them a storm of stones, except the family of Lot - We saved them before dawn.

**35.** (35) As favor from Us. Thus do We reward he who is grateful.

**36.** (36) And he had already warned them of Our assault, but they disputed the warning.

**37.** (37) And they had demanded from him his guests, but We obliterated their eyes, [saying], "Taste My punishment and warning."

**38.** (38) And there came upon them by morning an abiding punishment.

**39.** (39) So taste My punishment and warning.

**40.** (40) And We have certainly made the Qur�?n easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

**41.** (41) And there certainly came to the people of Pharaoh warning.

**42.** (42) They denied Our signs, all of them, so We seized them with a seizure of one Exalted in Might and Perfect in Ability.

**43.** (43) Are your disbelievers better than those [former ones], or have you immunity in the scriptures?

**44.** (44) Or do they say, "We are an assembly supporting [each other]"?

**45.** (45) [Their] assembly will be defeated, and they will turn their backs [in retreat].[1587]

**46.** (46) But the Hour is their appointment [for due punishment], and the Hour is more disastrous and more bitter.

**47.** (47) Indeed, the criminals are in error and madness.[1588].

**48.** (48) The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces [it will be said], "Taste the touch of Saqar."[1589]

**49.** (49) Indeed, all things We created with predestination.

**50.** (50) And Our command is but one, like a glance of the eye.

**51.** (51) And We have already destroyed your kinds,[1590] so is there any who will remember?

**52.** (52) And everything they did is in written records.

**53.** (53) And every small and great [thing] is inscribed.

**54.** (54) Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and rivers,

**55.** (55) In a seat of honor near a Sovereign, Perfect in Ability.[1591]
