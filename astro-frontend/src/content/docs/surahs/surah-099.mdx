description: Translation of Surah 99 - The Earthquake (Az-Zalzalah)
---

**1.** (1) When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquake

**2.** (2) And the earth discharges its burdens[1962]

**3.** (3) And man says,[1963] "What is [wrong] with it?" -

**4.** (4) That Day, it will report its news

**5.** (5) Because your Lord has inspired [i.e., commanded] it.

**6.** (6) That Day, the people will depart[1964] separated [into categories] to be shown [the result of] their deeds.

**7.** (7) So whoever does an atom's weight[1965] of good will see it,

**8.** (8) And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
