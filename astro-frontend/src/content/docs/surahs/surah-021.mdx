description: Translation of Surah 21 - The Prophets (Al-Anbya)
---

**1.** (1) [The time of] their account has approached for the people, while they are in heedlessness turning away.

**2.** (2) No mention [i.e., revelation] comes to them anew from their Lord except that they listen to it while they are at play

**3.** (3) With their hearts distracted. And those who do wrong conceal their private conversation, [saying], "Is this [Prophet] except a human being like you? So would you approach magic while you are aware [of it]?"

**4.** (4) He [the Prophet (?)] said, "My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."

**5.** (5) But they say, "[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams; rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign just as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles]."

**6.** (6) Not a [single] city which We destroyed believed before them,[872] so will they believe?

**7.** (7) And We sent not before you, [O Mu?ammad], except men to whom We revealed [the message], so ask the people of the message [i.e., former scriptures] if you do not know.

**8.** (8) And We did not make them [i.e., the prophets] forms not eating food,[873] nor were they immortal [on earth].

**9.** (9) Then[874] We fulfilled for them the promise, and We saved them and whom We willed and destroyed the transgressors.

**10.** (10) We have certainly sent down to you a Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] in which is your mention.[875] Then will you not reason?

**11.** (11) And how many a city which was unjust[876] have We shattered and produced after it another people.

**12.** (12) And when they [i.e., its inhabitants] perceived Our punishment, at once they fled from it.

**13.** (13) [Some angels said], "Do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes - perhaps you will be questioned."[877]

**14.** (14) They said, "O woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers."

**15.** (15) And that declaration of theirs did not cease until We made them [as] a harvest [mowed down], extinguished [like a fire].

**16.** (16) And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.

**17.** (17) Had We intended to take a diversion,[878] We could have taken it from [what is] with Us - if [indeed] We were to do so.

**18.** (18) Rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it,[879] and thereupon it departs. And for you is destruction from that which you describe.[880]

**19.** (19) To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those near Him [i.e., the angels] are not prevented by arrogance from His worship, nor do they tire.

**20.** (20) They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.

**21.** (21) Or have they [i.e., men] taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect [the dead]?

**22.** (22) Had there been within them [i.e., the heavens and earth] gods besides All?h, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is All?h, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.

**23.** (23) He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.

**24.** (24) Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, [O Mu?ammad], "Produce your proof. This [Qur�?n] is the message for those with me and the message of those before me."[881] But most of them do not know the truth, so they are turning away.

**25.** (25) And We sent not before you any messenger except We revealed to him that, "There is no deity except Me, so worship Me."

**26.** (26) And they say, "The Most Merciful has taken a son." Exalted is He! Rather, they[882] are [but] honored servants.

**27.** (27) They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command.

**28.** (28) He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[883] and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.

**29.** (29) And whoever of them should say, "Indeed, I am a god besides Him" - that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.

**30.** (30) Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and then We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?

**31.** (31) And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.

**32.** (32) And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs,[884] are turning away.

**33.** (33) And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.

**34.** (34) And We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?

**35.** (35) Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.

**36.** (36) And when those who disbelieve see you, [O Mu?ammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], "Is this the one who mentions [i.e., insults] your gods?" And they are, at the mention of the Most Merciful, disbelievers.

**37.** (37) Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience]. I will show you My signs [i.e., vengeance], so do not impatiently urge Me.

**38.** (38) And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"

**39.** (39) If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided...[885]

**40.** (40) Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.

**41.** (41) And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.

**42.** (42) Say, "Who can protect you at night or by day from the Most Merciful?" But they are, from the remembrance of their Lord, turning away.

**43.** (43) Or do they have gods to defend them other than Us? They are unable [even] to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us.

**44.** (44) But, [on the contrary], We have provided good things for these [disbelievers] and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. Then do they not see that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders?[886] Is it they who will overcome?

**45.** (45) Say, "I only warn you by revelation." But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.

**46.** (46) And if [as much as] a whiff of the punishment of your Lord should touch them, they would surely say, "O woe to us! Indeed, we have been wrongdoers."

**47.** (47) And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed,[887] We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant.

**48.** (48) And We had already given Moses and Aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder[888] for the righteous

**49.** (49) Who fear their Lord unseen,[889] while they are of the Hour apprehensive.

**50.** (50) And this [Qur�?n] is a blessed message which We have sent down. Then are you with it unacquainted?[890]

**51.** (51) And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement before,[891] and We were of him well-Knowing

**52.** (52) When he said to his father and his people, "What are these statues to which you are devoted?"

**53.** (53) They said, "We found our fathers worshippers of them."

**54.** (54) He said, "You were certainly, you and your fathers, in manifest error."

**55.** (55) They said, "Have you come to us with truth, or are you of those who jest?"

**56.** (56) He said, "[No], rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth who created them, and I, to that, am of those who testify.

**57.** (57) And [I swear] by All?h, I will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away."

**58.** (58) So he made them into fragments, except a large one among them, that they might return to it [and question].

**59.** (59) They said, "Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is of the wrongdoers."

**60.** (60) They said, "We heard a young man mention them who is called Abraham."

**61.** (61) They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify."[892]

**62.** (62) They said, "Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?"

**63.** (63) He said, "Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be able to] speak."

**64.** (64) So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said [to each other], "Indeed, you are the wrongdoers."

**65.** (65) Then they reversed themselves,[893] [saying], "You have already known that these do not speak!"

**66.** (66) He said, "Then do you worship instead of All?h that which does not benefit you at all or harm you?

**67.** (67) Uff[894] to you and to what you worship instead of All?h. Then will you not use reason?"

**68.** (68) They said, "Burn him and support your gods - if you are to act."

**69.** (69) We [i.e., All?h] said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."

**70.** (70) And they intended for him a plan [i.e., harm], but We made them the greatest losers.

**71.** (71) And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for the worlds [i.e., peoples].

**72.** (72) And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in addition, and all [of them] We made righteous.

**73.** (73) And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of zak?h; and they were worshippers of Us.

**74.** (74) And to Lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds. Indeed, they were a people of evil, defiantly disobedient.

**75.** (75) And We admitted him into Our mercy. Indeed, he was of the righteous.

**76.** (76) And [mention] Noah, when he called [to All?h][895] before [that time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great affliction [i.e., the flood].

**77.** (77) And We aided [i.e., saved] him from the people who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were a people of evil, so We drowned them, all together.

**78.** (78) And [mention] David and Solomon, when they judged concerning the field - when the sheep of a people overran it [at night],[896] and We were witness to their judgement.

**79.** (79) And We gave understanding of it [i.e., the case] to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains to exalt [Us], along with David and [also] the birds. And We were doing [that].[897]

**80.** (80) And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. So will you then be grateful?

**81.** (81) And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing forcefully, proceeding by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And We are ever, of all things, Knowing.

**82.** (82) And of the devils [i.e., jinn] were those who dived for him and did work other than that. And We were of them a guardian.[898]

**83.** (83) And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the most merciful of the merciful."

**84.** (84) So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of All?h].

**85.** (85) And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient.

**86.** (86) And We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed, they were of the righteous.

**87.** (87) And [mention] the man of the fish [i.e., Jonah], when he went off in anger[899] and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him.[900] And he called out within the darknesses,[901] "There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers."

**88.** (88) So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers.

**89.** (89) And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, "My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while You are the best of inheritors."

**90.** (90) So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate[902] Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.

**91.** (91) And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity [i.e., Mary], so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [i.e., Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.

**92.** (92) Indeed this, your religion, is one religion,[903] and I am your Lord, so worship Me.

**93.** (93) And [yet] they divided their affair [i.e., that of their religion] among themselves,[904] [but] all to Us will return.

**94.** (94) So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - no denial will there be for his effort,[905] and indeed We [i.e., Our angels], of it, are recorders.

**95.** (95) And it is prohibited to [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return[906]

**96.** (96) Until when [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and they, from every elevation, descend

**97.** (97) And [when] the true promise [i.e., the resurrection] has approached; then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring [in horror, while they say], "O woe to us; we had been unmindful of this; rather, we were wrongdoers."

**98.** (98) Indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than All?h are the firewood of Hell. You will be coming to [enter] it.

**99.** (99) Had these [false deities] been [actual] gods, they would not have come to it, but all are eternal therein.

**100.** (100) For them therein is heavy sighing, and they therein will not hear.

**101.** (101) Indeed, those for whom the best [reward] has preceded from Us - they are from it far removed.

**102.** (102) They will not hear its sound, while they are, in that which their souls desire, abiding eternally.

**103.** (103) They will not be grieved by the greatest terror,[907] and the angels will meet them, [saying], "This is your Day which you have been promised" -

**104.** (104) The Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [That is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it.[908]

**105.** (105) And We have already written in the book [of Psalms][909] after the [previous] mention[910] that the land [of Paradise] is inherited by My righteous servants.

**106.** (106) Indeed, in this [Qur�?n] is notification for a worshipping people.

**107.** (107) And We have not sent you, [O Mu?ammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.

**108.** (108) Say, "It is only revealed to me that your god is but one God; so will you be Muslims [in submission to Him]?"

**109.** (109) But if they turn away, then say, "I have announced to [all of] you equally.[911] And I know not whether near or far is that which you are promised.

**110.** (110) Indeed, He knows what is declared of speech, and He knows what you conceal.

**111.** (111) And I know not; perhaps it[912] is a trial for you and enjoyment for a time."

**112.** (112) [The Prophet (?)] has said, "My Lord, judge [between us] in truth. And our Lord is the Most Merciful, the one whose help is sought against that which you describe."[913]
