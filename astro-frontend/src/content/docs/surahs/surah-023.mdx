description: Translation of Surah 23 - The Believers (Al-Mu'minun)

**1.** (1) Certainly will the believers have succeeded:

**2.** (2) They who are during their prayer humbly intent

**3.** (3) And they who turn away from ill speech

**4.** (4) And they who are observant of zak?h

**5.** (5) And they who guard their private parts

**6.** (6) Except from their wives or those their right hands possess,[947] for indeed, they will not be blamed -

**7.** (7) But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors -

**8.** (8) And they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive

**9.** (9) And they who carefully maintain their prayers -

**10.** (10) Those are the inheritors

**11.** (11) Who will inherit al-Firdaus.[948] They will abide therein eternally.

**12.** (12) And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.

**13.** (13) Then We placed him as a sperm-drop[949] in a firm lodging [i.e., the womb].

**14.** (14) Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is All?h, the best of creators.[950]

**15.** (15) Then indeed, after that you are to die.

**16.** (16) Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected.

**17.** (17) And We have created above you seven layered heavens, and never have We been of [Our] creation unaware.

**18.** (18) And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away.

**19.** (19) And We brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat.

**20.** (20) And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which produces oil and food [i.e., olives] for those who eat.

**21.** (21) And indeed, for you in livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from that which is in their bellies, and for you in them are numerous benefits, and from them you eat.

**22.** (22) And upon them and on ships you are carried.

**23.** (23) And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, "O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?"

**24.** (24) But the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, "This is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you; and if All?h had willed [to send a messenger], He would have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our forefathers.

**25.** (25) He is not but a man possessed with madness, so wait concerning him for a time."

**26.** (26) [Noah] said, "My Lord, support me because they have denied me."

**27.** (27) So We inspired to him, "Construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration, and when Our command comes and the oven overflows,[951] put into it [i.e., the ship] from each [creature] two mates and your family, except him for whom the decree [of destruction] has proceeded. And do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.

**28.** (28) And when you have boarded the ship, you and those with you, then say, 'Praise to All?h who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.'

**29.** (29) And say, 'My Lord, let me land at a blessed landing place, and You are the best to accommodate [us].'"

**30.** (30) Indeed in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever testing [Our servants].

**31.** (31) Then We produced after them a generation of others.

**32.** (32) And We sent among them a messenger[952] from themselves, [saying], "Worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?"

**33.** (33) And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter while We had given them luxury in the worldly life said, "This is not but a man like yourselves. He eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink.

**34.** (34) And if you should obey a man like yourselves, indeed, you would then be losers.

**35.** (35) Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth [once more]?

**36.** (36) How far, how far, is that which you are promised.[953]

**37.** (37) It [i.e., life] is not but our worldly life - we die and live, but we will not be resurrected.

**38.** (38) He is not but a man who has invented a lie about All?h, and we will not believe him."

**39.** (39) He said, "My Lord, support me because they have denied me."

**40.** (40) [All?h] said, "After a little, they will surely become regretful."

**41.** (41) So the shriek[954] seized them in truth,[955] and We made them as [plant] stubble. Then away with the wrongdoing people.

**42.** (42) Then We produced after them other generations.

**43.** (43) No nation will precede its time [of termination], nor will they remain [thereafter].

**44.** (44) Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation its messenger, they denied him, so We made them follow one another [to destruction], and We made them narrations.[956] So away with a people who do not believe.

**45.** (45) Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority[957]

**46.** (46) To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were arrogant and were a haughty people.

**47.** (47) They said, "Should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude?"

**48.** (48) So they denied them and were of those destroyed.

**49.** (49) And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture that perhaps they[958] would be guided.

**50.** (50) And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level [areas] and flowing water.

**51.** (51) [All?h said], "O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Knowing.

**52.** (52) And indeed this, your religion, is one religion,[959] and I am your Lord, so fear Me."

**53.** (53) But they [i.e., the people] divided their religion among them into portions [i.e., sects] - each faction, in what it has,[960] rejoicing.

**54.** (54) So leave them in their confusion for a time.

**55.** (55) Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children

**56.** (56) Is [because] We hasten for them good things? Rather, they do not perceive.[961]

**57.** (57) Indeed, they who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord

**58.** (58) And they who believe in the signs of their Lord

**59.** (59) And they who do not associate anything with their Lord

**60.** (60) And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful[962] because they will be returning to their Lord -

**61.** (61) It is those who hasten to good deeds, and they outstrip [others] therein.

**62.** (62) And We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity, and with Us is a record which speaks with truth; and they will not be wronged.

**63.** (63) But their hearts are covered with confusion over this, and they have [evil] deeds besides that [i.e., disbelief] which they are doing,

**64.** (64) Until when We seize their affluent ones with punishment,[963] at once they are crying [to All?h] for help.

**65.** (65) Do not cry out today. Indeed, by Us you will not be helped.

**66.** (66) My verses had already been recited to you, but you were turning back on your heels

**67.** (67) In arrogance regarding it,[964] conversing by night, speaking evil.

**68.** (68) Then have they not reflected over the word [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n], or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers?

**69.** (69) Or did they not know their Messenger, so they are toward him disacknowledging?

**70.** (70) Or do they say, "In him is madness"? Rather, he brought them the truth, but most of them, to the truth, are averse.

**71.** (71) But if the Truth [i.e., All?h] had followed their inclinations, the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. Rather, We have brought them their message,[965] but they, from their message, are turning away.

**72.** (72) Or do you, [O Mu?ammad], ask them for payment? But the reward of your Lord is best, and He is the best of providers.

**73.** (73) And indeed, you invite them to a straight path.

**74.** (74) But indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from the path.

**75.** (75) And even if We gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction, they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.

**76.** (76) And We had gripped them with suffering [as a warning], but they did not yield to their Lord, nor did they humbly supplicate, [and will continue thus]

**77.** (77) Until when We have opened before them a door of severe punishment, immediately they will be therein in despair.

**78.** (78) And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful.

**79.** (79) And it is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.

**80.** (80) And it is He who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the night and the day. Then will you not reason?

**81.** (81) Rather,[966] they say like what the former peoples said.

**82.** (82) They said, "When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?

**83.** (83) We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before; this is not but legends of the former peoples."

**84.** (84) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?"

**85.** (85) They will say, "To All?h." Say, "Then will you not remember?"

**86.** (86) Say, "Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?"

**87.** (87) They will say, "[They belong] to All?h." Say, "Then will you not fear Him?"

**88.** (88) Say, "In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?"

**89.** (89) They will say, "[All belongs] to All?h." Say, "Then how are you deluded?"

**90.** (90) Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.

**91.** (91) All?h has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have [sought to] overcome others. Exalted is All?h above what they describe [concerning Him].

**92.** (92) [He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He above what they associate [with Him].

**93.** (93) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "My Lord, if You should show me that which they are promised,

**94.** (94) My Lord, then do not place me among the wrongdoing people."

**95.** (95) And indeed, We are Able to show you what We have promised them.

**96.** (96) Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most knowing of what they describe.

**97.** (97) And say, "My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils,

**98.** (98) And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me."

**99.** (99) [For such is the state of the disbelievers] until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back

**100.** (100) That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind."[967] No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.

**101.** (101) So when the Horn is blown, no relationship will there be among them that Day, nor will they ask about one another.

**102.** (102) And those whose scales are heavy [with good deeds] - it is they who are the successful.

**103.** (103) But those whose scales are light - those are the ones who have lost their souls, [being] in Hell, abiding eternally.

**104.** (104) The Fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut smiles.[968]

**105.** (105) [It will be said], "Were not My verses recited to you and you used to deny them?"

**106.** (106) They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray.

**107.** (107) Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would indeed be wrongdoers."

**108.** (108) He will say, "Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.

**109.** (109) Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the best of the merciful.'

**110.** (110) But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.

**111.** (111) Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient endurance - that they are the attainers [of success]."

**112.** (112) [All?h] will say, "How long did you remain on earth in number of years?"

**113.** (113) They will say, "We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate."

**114.** (114) He will say, "You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.

**115.** (115) Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"

**116.** (116) So exalted is All?h, the Sovereign,[969] the Truth;[970] there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne.

**117.** (117) And whoever invokes besides All?h another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.

**118.** (118) And, [O Mu?ammad], say, "My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful."
