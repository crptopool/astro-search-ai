description: Translation of Surah 75 - The Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah)
---

**1.** (1) I swear by the Day of Resurrection

**2.** (2) And I swear by the reproaching soul[1800] [to the certainty of resurrection].

**3.** (3) Does man think that We will not assemble his bones?

**4.** (4) Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips.

**5.** (5) But man desires to continue in sin.[1801]

**6.** (6) He asks, "When is the Day of Resurrection?"

**7.** (7) So when vision is dazzled

**8.** (8) And the moon darkens

**9.** (9) And the sun and the moon are joined,

**10.** (10) Man will say on that Day, "Where is the [place of] escape?"

**11.** (11) No! There is no refuge.

**12.** (12) To your Lord, that Day, is the [place of] permanence.

**13.** (13) Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead[1802] and kept back.[1803]

**14.** (14) Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness,[1804]

**15.** (15) Even if he presents his excuses.

**16.** (16) Move not your tongue with it, [O Mu?ammad], to hasten with it [i.e., recitation of the Qurï¿½?n].

**17.** (17) Indeed, upon Us is its collection [in your heart] and [to make possible] its recitation.

**18.** (18) So when We have recited it [through Gabriel], then follow its recitation.

**19.** (19) Then upon Us is its clarification [to you].

**20.** (20) No! But you [i.e., mankind] love the immediate

**21.** (21) And leave [i.e., neglect] the Hereafter.

**22.** (22) [Some] faces, that Day, will be radiant,

**23.** (23) Looking at their Lord.[1805]

**24.** (24) And [some] faces, that Day, will be contorted,

**25.** (25) Expecting that there will be done to them [something] backbreaking.

**26.** (26) No! When it [i.e., the soul] has reached the collar bones[1806]

**27.** (27) And it is said, "Who will cure [him]?"

**28.** (28) And he [i.e., the dying one] is certain that it is the [time of] separation

**29.** (29) And the leg is wound about the leg,[1807]

**30.** (30) To your Lord, that Day, will be the procession.[1808]

**31.** (31) And he [i.e., the disbeliever] had not believed, nor had he prayed.

**32.** (32) But [instead], he denied and turned away.

**33.** (33) And then he went to his people, swaggering [in pride].

**34.** (34) Woe to you, and woe!

**35.** (35) Then woe to you, and woe!

**36.** (36) Does man think that he will be left neglected?[1809]

**37.** (37) Had he not been a sperm from semen emitted?

**38.** (38) Then he was a clinging clot, and [All?h] created [his form] and proportioned [him]

**39.** (39) And made of him two mates, the male and the female.

**40.** (40) Is not that [Creator] Able to give life to the dead?
