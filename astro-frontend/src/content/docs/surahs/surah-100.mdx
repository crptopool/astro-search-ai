**1.** (1) By the racers, panting,[1967]

**2.** (2) And the producers of sparks [when] striking[1968]

**3.** (3) And the chargers at dawn,[1969]

**4.** (4) Stirring up thereby [clouds of] dust,

**5.** (5) Arriving thereby in the center[1970] collectively,

**6.** (6) Indeed mankind, to his Lord, is ungrateful.

**7.** (7) And indeed, he is to that a witness.[1971]

**8.** (8) And indeed he is, in love of wealth, intense.

**9.** (9) But does he not know that when the contents of the graves are scattered

**10.** (10) And that within the breasts is obtained,[1972]

**11.** (11) Indeed, their Lord with them, that Day, is [fully] Aware.[1973]
