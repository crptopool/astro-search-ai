description: Translation of Surah 64 - The Mutual Disillusion (At-Taghabun)
---

**1.** (1) Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting All?h.[1692] To Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs [all] praise, and He is over all things competent.

**2.** (2) It is He who created you, and among you is the disbeliever, and among you is the believer. And All?h, of what you do, is Seeing.

**3.** (3) He created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms; and to Him is the [final] destination.

**4.** (4) He knows what is within the heavens and earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare. And All?h is Knowing of that within the breasts.

**5.** (5) Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment.

**6.** (6) That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear evidences, but they said, "Shall human beings guide us?" and disbelieved and turned away. And All?h dispensed [with them]; and All?h is Free of need and Praiseworthy.

**7.** (7) Those who disbelieve have claimed that they will never be resurrected. Say, "Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected; then you will surely be informed of what you did. And that, for All?h, is easy."

**8.** (8) So believe in All?h and His Messenger and the light [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] which We have sent down. And All?h is Aware of what you do.

**9.** (9) The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly - that is the Day of Deprivation.[1693] And whoever believes in All?h and does righteousness - He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.

**10.** (10) But the ones who disbelieved and denied Our verses - those are the companions of the Fire, abiding eternally therein; and wretched is the destination.

**11.** (11) No disaster strikes except by permission of All?h. And whoever believes in All?h - He will guide his heart. And All?h is Knowing of all things.

**12.** (12) And obey All?h and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away - then upon Our Messenger is only [the duty of] clear notification.

**13.** (13) All?h - there is no deity except Him. And upon All?h let the believers rely.

**14.** (14) O you who have believed, indeed, among your spouses and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. But if you pardon and overlook and forgive - then indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.

**15.** (15) Your wealth and your children are but a trial, and All?h has with Him a great reward.

**16.** (16) So fear All?h as much as you are able and listen and obey and spend [in the way of All?h]; it is better for your selves. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful.

**17.** (17) If you loan All?h a goodly loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you. And All?h is [most] Appreciative[1694] and Forbearing,[1695]

**18.** (18) Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
