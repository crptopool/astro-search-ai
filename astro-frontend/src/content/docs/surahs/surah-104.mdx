**1.** (1) Woe to every scorner and mocker

**2.** (2) Who collects wealth and [continuously] counts it.[1987]

**3.** (3) He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.

**4.** (4) No! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher.[1988]

**5.** (5) And what can make you know what is the Crusher?

**6.** (6) It is the fire of All?h, [eternally] fueled,

**7.** (7) Which mounts directed at the hearts.[1989]

**8.** (8) Indeed, it [i.e., Hellfire] will be closed down upon them

**9.** (9) In extended columns.[1990]
