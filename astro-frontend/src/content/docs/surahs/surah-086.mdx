description: Translation of Surah 86 - The Nightcommer (At-Tariq)
---

**1.** (1) By the sky and the knocker

**2.** (2) And what can make you know what is the knocker?

**3.** (3) It is the piercing star[1901].

**4.** (4) There is no soul but that it has over it a protector.

**5.** (5) So let man observe from what he was created.

**6.** (6) He was created from a fluid, ejected,

**7.** (7) Emerging from between the backbone and the ribs.

**8.** (8) Indeed, He [i.e., All?h], to return him [to life], is Able.

**9.** (9) The Day when secrets will be put on trial,[1902]

**10.** (10) Then he [i.e., man] will have no power or any helper.

**11.** (11) By the sky which sends back[1903]

**12.** (12) And [by] the earth which splits,[1904]

**13.** (13) Indeed, it [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] is a decisive statement,

**14.** (14) And it is not amusement.

**15.** (15) Indeed, they are planning a plan,

**16.** (16) But I am planning a plan.

**17.** (17) So allow time for the disbelievers. Leave them awhile.[1905]
