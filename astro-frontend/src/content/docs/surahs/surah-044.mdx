**1.** (1) ??, Meem.[1458]

**2.** (2) By the clear Book,

**3.** (3) Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night.[1459] Indeed, We were to warn [mankind].

**4.** (4) Therein [i.e., on that night] is made distinct[1460] every precise matter -

**5.** (5) [Every] matter [proceeding] from Us. Indeed, We were to send [a messenger]

**6.** (6) As mercy from your Lord. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing,

**7.** (7) Lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them, if you would be certain.

**8.** (8) There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.

**9.** (9) But they are in doubt, amusing themselves.

**10.** (10) Then watch for the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke

**11.** (11) Covering the people; this is a painful torment.

**12.** (12) [They will say], "Our Lord, remove from us the torment; indeed, we are believers."

**13.** (13) How will there be for them a reminder [at that time]? And there had come to them a clear Messenger.

**14.** (14) Then they turned away from him and said, "[He was] taught [and is] a madman."

**15.** (15) Indeed, We will remove the torment for a little. Indeed, you [disbelievers] will return [to disbelief].

**16.** (16) The Day We will strike with the greatest assault, indeed, We will take retribution.

**17.** (17) And We had already tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there came to them a noble messenger [i.e., Moses],

**18.** (18) [Saying], "Render to me the servants of All?h.[1461] Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger,"

**19.** (19) And [saying], "Be not haughty with All?h. Indeed, I have come to you with clear evidence.

**20.** (20) And indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone me.[1462]

**21.** (21) But if you do not believe me, then leave me alone."

**22.** (22) And [finally] he called to his Lord that these were a criminal people.

**23.** (23) [All?h said], "Then set out with My servants by night. Indeed, you are to be pursued.

**24.** (24) And leave the sea in stillness.[1463] Indeed, they are an army to be drowned."

**25.** (25) How much they left behind of gardens and springs

**26.** (26) And crops and noble sites

**27.** (27) And comfort wherein they were amused.

**28.** (28) Thus. And We caused to inherit it another people.

**29.** (29) And the heaven and earth wept not for them, nor were they reprieved.

**30.** (30) And We certainly saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating torment -

**31.** (31) From Pharaoh. Indeed, he was a haughty one among the transgressors.

**32.** (32) And We certainly chose them by knowledge over [all] the worlds.

**33.** (33) And We gave them of signs that in which there was a clear trial.

**34.** (34) Indeed, these [disbelievers] are saying,

**35.** (35) "There is not but our first death, and we will not be resurrected.

**36.** (36) Then bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful."

**37.** (37) Are they better or the people of Tubba?[1464] and those before them? We destroyed them, [for] indeed, they were criminals.

**38.** (38) And We did not create the heavens and earth and that between them in play.

**39.** (39) We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know.

**40.** (40) Indeed, the Day of Judgement is the appointed time for them all -

**41.** (41) The Day when no relation[1465] will avail a relation at all, nor will they be helped -

**42.** (42) Except those [believers] on whom All?h has mercy. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.

**43.** (43) Indeed, the tree of zaqq?m

**44.** (44) Is food for the sinful.

**45.** (45) Like murky oil, it boils within bellies

**46.** (46) Like the boiling of scalding water.

**47.** (47) [It will be commanded], "Seize him and drag him into the midst of the Hellfire,

**48.** (48) Then pour over his head from the torment of scalding water."

**49.** (49) [It will be said], "Taste! Indeed, you are the honored, the noble![1466]

**50.** (50) Indeed, this is what you used to dispute."

**51.** (51) Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure place:

**52.** (52) Within gardens and springs,

**53.** (53) Wearing [garments of] fine silk and brocade, facing each other.

**54.** (54) Thus. And We will marry them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes.

**55.** (55) They will call therein for every [kind of] fruit - safe and secure.

**56.** (56) They will not taste death therein except the first death, and He will have protected them from the punishment of Hellfire

**57.** (57) As bounty from your Lord. That is what is the great attainment.

**58.** (58) And indeed, We have eased it [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] in your tongue that they might be reminded.

**59.** (59) So watch, [O Mu?ammad]; indeed, they are watching [for your end].
