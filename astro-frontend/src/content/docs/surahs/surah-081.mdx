description: Translation of Surah 81 - The Overthrowing (At-Takwir)
---

**1.** (1) When the sun is wrapped up [in darkness]

**2.** (2) And when the stars fall, dispersing,

**3.** (3) And when the mountains are removed

**4.** (4) And when full-term she-camels[1865] are neglected

**5.** (5) And when the wild beasts are gathered

**6.** (6) And when the seas are filled with flame[1866]

**7.** (7) And when the souls are paired[1867]

**8.** (8) And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked

**9.** (9) For what sin she was killed

**10.** (10) And when the pages[1868] are spread [i.e., made public]

**11.** (11) And when the sky is stripped away

**12.** (12) And when Hellfire is set ablaze

**13.** (13) And when Paradise is brought near,

**14.** (14) A soul will [then] know what it has brought [with it].[1869]

**15.** (15) So I swear by the retreating stars -

**16.** (16) Those that run [their courses] and disappear [i.e., set]

**17.** (17) And by the night as it closes in[1870]

**18.** (18) And by the dawn when it breathes [i.e., stirs]

**19.** (19) [That] indeed, it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is a word [conveyed by] a noble messenger [i.e., Gabriel]

**20.** (20) [Who is] possessed of power and with the Owner of the Throne, secure [in position],

**21.** (21) Obeyed there [in the heavens] and trustworthy.

**22.** (22) And your companion [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?) ] is not [at all] mad.[1871]

**23.** (23) And he has already seen him [i.e., Gabriel] in the clear horizon.[1872]

**24.** (24) And he [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] is not a withholder of [knowledge of] the unseen.[1873]

**25.** (25) And it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is not the word of a devil, expelled [from the heavens].

**26.** (26) So where are you going?[1874]

**27.** (27) It is not except a reminder to the worlds

**28.** (28) For whoever wills among you to take a right course.

**29.** (29) And you do not will except that All?h wills - Lord of the worlds.
