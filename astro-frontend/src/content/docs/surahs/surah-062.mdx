description: Translation of Surah 62 - The Congregation, Friday (Al-Jumu'ah)
---

**1.** (1) Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting All?h,[1685] the Sovereign, the Pure, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.[1686]

**2.** (2) It is He who has sent among the unlettered [Arabs] a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] and wisdom [i.e., the sunnah] - although they were before in clear error -

**3.** (3) And [to] others of them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

**4.** (4) That is the bounty of All?h, which He gives to whom He wills, and All?h is the possessor of great bounty.

**5.** (5) The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on[1687] is like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books].[1688] Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of All?h. And All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.

**6.** (6) Say, "O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of All?h, excluding the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful."

**7.** (7) But they will not wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And All?h is Knowing of the wrongdoers.

**8.** (8) Say, "Indeed, the death from which you flee - indeed, it will meet you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do."

**9.** (9) O you who have believed, when [the adh?n] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu?ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of All?h and leave trade. That is better for you, if you only knew.

**10.** (10) And when the prayer has been concluded, disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of All?h, and remember All?h often that you may succeed.

**11.** (11) But [on one occasion] when they saw a transaction or a diversion, [O Mu?ammad], they rushed to it and left you standing. Say, "What is with All?h is better than diversion and than a transaction, and All?h is the best of providers."
