description: Translation of Surah 82 - The Cleaving (Al-Infitar)
---

**1.** (1) When the sky breaks apart

**2.** (2) And when the stars fall, scattering,

**3.** (3) And when the seas are erupted

**4.** (4) And when the [contents of] graves are scattered [i.e., exposed],

**5.** (5) A soul will [then] know what it has put forth and kept back.

**6.** (6) O mankind, what has deceived you concerning your Lord, the Generous,

**7.** (7) Who created you, proportioned you, and balanced you?

**8.** (8) In whatever form He willed has He assembled you.

**9.** (9) No! But you deny the Recompense.

**10.** (10) And indeed, [appointed] over you are keepers,[1876]

**11.** (11) Noble and recording;

**12.** (12) They know whatever you do.

**13.** (13) Indeed, the righteous will be in pleasure,

**14.** (14) And indeed, the wicked will be in Hellfire.

**15.** (15) They will [enter to] burn therein on the Day of Recompense,

**16.** (16) And never therefrom will they be absent.

**17.** (17) And what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense?

**18.** (18) Then, what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense?

**19.** (19) It is the Day when a soul will not possess for another soul [power to do] a thing; and the command, that Day, is [entirely] with All?h.
