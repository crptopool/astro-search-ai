**1.** (1) By the [winds] scattering [dust], dispersing [it]

**2.** (2) And the [clouds] carrying a load [of water]

**3.** (3) And the ships sailing with ease

**4.** (4) And the [angels] apportioning [each] matter,

**5.** (5) Indeed, what you are promised is true.

**6.** (6) And indeed, the recompense is to occur.

**7.** (7) By the heaven containing pathways,[1535]

**8.** (8) Indeed, you are in differing speech.[1536]

**9.** (9) Deluded away from it [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] is he who is deluded.

**10.** (10) Destroyed are the misinformers[1537]

**11.** (11) Who are within a flood [of confusion] and heedless.

**12.** (12) They ask, "When is the Day of Recompense?"

**13.** (13) [It is] the Day they will be tormented over the Fire

**14.** (14) [And will be told], "Taste your torment. This is that for which you were impatient."

**15.** (15) Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and springs,

**16.** (16) Accepting what their Lord has given them. Indeed, they were before that doers of good.

**17.** (17) They used to sleep but little of the night,[1538]

**18.** (18) And in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness,

**19.** (19) And from their properties was [given] the right of the [needy] petitioner and the deprived.

**20.** (20) And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith]

**21.** (21) And in yourselves. Then will you not see?

**22.** (22) And in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised.

**23.** (23) Then by the Lord of the heaven and earth, indeed, it is truth - just as [sure as] it is that you are speaking.

**24.** (24) Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Abraham?[1539] -

**25.** (25) When they entered upon him and said, "[We greet you with] peace." He answered, "[And upon you] peace; [you are] a people unknown."

**26.** (26) Then he went to his family and came with a fat [roasted] calf.

**27.** (27) And placed it near them; he said, "Will you not eat?"

**28.** (28) And he felt from them apprehension.[1540] They said, "Fear not," and gave him good tidings of a learned boy.

**29.** (29) And his wife approached with a cry [of alarm] and struck her face and said, "[I am] a barren old woman!"

**30.** (30) They said, "Thus has said your Lord; indeed, He is the Wise, the Knowing."

**31.** (31) [Abraham] said, "Then what is your business [here], O messengers?"

**32.** (32) They said, "Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals[1541]

**33.** (33) To send down upon them stones of clay,

**34.** (34) Marked in the presence of your Lord for the transgressors."

**35.** (35) So We brought out whoever was in them [i.e., the cities] of the believers.

**36.** (36) And We found not within them other than a [single] house of Muslims.[1542]

**37.** (37) And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.

**38.** (38) And in Moses [was a sign], when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority.[1543]

**39.** (39) But he turned away with his supporters and said, "A magician or a madman."

**40.** (40) So We took him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea, and he was blameworthy.

**41.** (41) And in ?Aad [was a sign], when We sent against them the barren wind.[1544]

**42.** (42) It left nothing of what it came upon but that it made it like disintegrated ruins.

**43.** (43) And in Tham?d, when it was said to them, "Enjoy yourselves for a time."

**44.** (44) But they were insolent toward the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on.

**45.** (45) And they were unable to arise, nor could they defend themselves.

**46.** (46) And [We destroyed] the people of Noah before; indeed, they were a people defiantly disobedient.

**47.** (47) And the heaven We constructed with strength,[1545] and indeed, We are [its] expander.

**48.** (48) And the earth We have spread out, and excellent is the preparer.

**49.** (49) And of all things We created two mates [i.e., counterparts]; perhaps you will remember.

**50.** (50) So flee to All?h.[1546] Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.

**51.** (51) And do not make [as equal] with All?h another deity. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.

**52.** (52) Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, "A magician or a madman."

**53.** (53) Did they suggest it to them?[1547] Rather, they [themselves] are a transgressing people.

**54.** (54) So leave them, [O Mu?ammad], for you are not to be blamed.

**55.** (55) And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers.

**56.** (56) And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.

**57.** (57) I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.

**58.** (58) Indeed, it is All?h who is the [continual] Provider,[1548] the firm possessor of strength.

**59.** (59) And indeed, for those who have wronged is a portion [of punishment] like the portion of their companions [i.e., predecessors], so let them not impatiently urge Me.

**60.** (60) And woe to those who have disbelieved from their Day which they are promised.
