description: Translation of Surah 59 - The Exile (Al-Hashr)
---

**1.** (1) Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts All?h,[1650] and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.

**2.** (2) It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture[1651] from their homes at the first gathering.[1652] You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from All?h; but [the decree of] All?h came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision.

**3.** (3) And if not that All?h had decreed for them evacuation, He would have punished them in [this] world, and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire.

**4.** (4) That is because they opposed All?h and His Messenger. And whoever opposes All?h - then indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.

**5.** (5) Whatever you have cut down of [their] palm trees or left standing on their trunks - it was by permission of All?h and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient.

**6.** (6) And what All?h restored [of property] to His Messenger from them - you did not spur for it [in an expedition] any horses or camels,[1653] but All?h gives His messengers power over whom He wills, and All?h is over all things competent.

**7.** (7) And what All?h restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns - it is for All?h and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives[1654] and orphans and the needy and the [stranded] traveler[1655] - so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you. And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear All?h; indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.

**8.** (8) For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from All?h and [His] approval and supporting [the cause of] All?h and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful.

**9.** (9) And [also for] those who were settled in the Home [i.e.,al-Mad?nah] and [adopted] the faith before them.[1656] They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what they [i.e., the emigrants] were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful.

**10.** (10) And [there is a share for] those who come after them, saying, "Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful."

**11.** (11) Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers [i.e., associates] who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture, "If you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone - ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you." But All?h testifies that they are liars.

**12.** (12) If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided.

**13.** (13) You [believers] are more fearful within their breasts than All?h. That is because they are a people who do not understand.

**14.** (14) They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls. Their violence [i.e., enmity] among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not reason.

**15.** (15) [Theirs is] like the example of those shortly before them: they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment.

**16.** (16) [The hypocrites are] like the example of Satan when he says to man, "Disbelieve." But when he disbelieves, he says, "Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I fear All?h, Lord of the worlds."

**17.** (17) So the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire, abiding eternally therein. And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.

**18.** (18) O you who have believed, fear All?h. And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow - and fear All?h. Indeed, All?h is Aware of what you do.

**19.** (19) And be not like those who forgot All?h, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.

**20.** (20) Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise. The companions of Paradise - they are the attainers [of success].

**21.** (21) If We had sent down this Qurï¿½?n upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of All?h. And these examples We present to the people that perhaps they will give thought.

**22.** (22) He is All?h, other than whom there is no deity, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed.[1657] He is the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

**23.** (23) He is All?h, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign,[1658] the Pure,[1659] the Perfection,[1660] the Grantor of Security,[1661] the Overseer,[1662] the Exalted in Might,[1663] the Compeller,[1664] the Superior.[1665] Exalted is All?h above whatever they associate with Him.

**24.** (24) He is All?h, the Creator,[1666] the Producer,[1667] the Fashioner;[1668] to Him belong the best names.[1669] Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.[1670]
