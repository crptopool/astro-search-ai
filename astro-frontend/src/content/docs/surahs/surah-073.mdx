description: Translation of Surah 73 - The Enshrouded One (Al-Muzzammil)
---

**1.** (1) O you who wraps himself [in clothing],[1778]

**2.** (2) Arise [to pray] the night, except for a little -

**3.** (3) Half of it - or subtract from it a little

**4.** (4) Or add to it, and recite the Qur�?n with measured recitation.

**5.** (5) Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.[1779]

**6.** (6) Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue][1780] and more suitable for words.[1781]

**7.** (7) Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.

**8.** (8) And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion.

**9.** (9) [He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs.[1782]

**10.** (10) And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.

**11.** (11) And leave Me with [the matter of] the deniers, those of ease [in life], and allow them respite a little.

**12.** (12) Indeed, with Us [for them] are shackles and burning fire

**13.** (13) And food that chokes and a painful punishment -

**14.** (14) On the Day the earth and the mountains will convulse and the mountains will become a heap of sand pouring down.

**15.** (15) Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you just as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.

**16.** (16) But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.

**17.** (17) Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a Day that will make the children white-haired?[1783]

**18.** (18) The heaven will break apart therefrom;[1784] ever is His promise fulfilled.

**19.** (19) Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way.

**20.** (20) Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Mu?ammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And All?h determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it[1785] and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur�?n. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of All?h and others fighting for the cause of All?h. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zak?h and loan All?h a goodly loan.[1786] And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with All?h. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.
