description: Translation of Surah 83 - The Defrauding (Al-Mutaffifin)
---

**1.** (1) Woe to those who give less [than due],[1878]

**2.** (2) Who, when they take a measure from people, take in full.

**3.** (3) But if they give by measure or by weight to them, they cause loss.

**4.** (4) Do they not think that they will be resurrected

**5.** (5) For a tremendous Day -

**6.** (6) The Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds?

**7.** (7) No! Indeed, the record of the wicked is in sijjeen.

**8.** (8) And what can make you know what is sijjeen?

**9.** (9) It is [their destination[1879] recorded in] a register inscribed.

**10.** (10) Woe, that Day, to the deniers,

**11.** (11) Who deny the Day of Recompense.

**12.** (12) And none deny it except every sinful transgressor.

**13.** (13) When Our verses are recited to him, he says, "Legends of the former peoples."

**14.** (14) No! Rather, the stain has covered their hearts of that which they were earning.[1880]

**15.** (15) No! Indeed, from their Lord, that Day, they will be partitioned.[1881]

**16.** (16) Then indeed, they will [enter and] burn in Hellfire.

**17.** (17) Then it will be said [to them], "This is what you used to deny."

**18.** (18) No! Indeed, the record of the righteous is in ?illiyy?n.

**19.** (19) And what can make you know what is ?illiyy?n?

**20.** (20) It is [their destination[1882] recorded in] a register inscribed

**21.** (21) Which is witnessed by those brought near [to All?h].

**22.** (22) Indeed, the righteous will be in pleasure

**23.** (23) On adorned couches, observing.

**24.** (24) You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.

**25.** (25) They will be given to drink [pure] wine[1883] [which was] sealed.

**26.** (26) The last of it[1884] is musk. So for this let the competitors compete.

**27.** (27) And its mixture is of Tasneem,[1885]

**28.** (28) A spring from which those near [to All?h] drink.

**29.** (29) Indeed, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.

**30.** (30) And when they passed by them, they would exchange derisive glances.

**31.** (31) And when they returned to their people, they would return jesting.

**32.** (32) And when they saw them, they would say, "Indeed, those are truly lost."

**33.** (33) But they had not been sent as guardians over them.

**34.** (34) So Today[1886] those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers,

**35.** (35) On adorned couches, observing.

**36.** (36) Have the disbelievers [not] been rewarded [this Day] for what they used to do?
