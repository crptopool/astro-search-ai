**1.** (1) Did We not expand for you, [O Mu?ammad], your breast?[1944]

**2.** (2) And We removed from you your burden[1945]

**3.** (3) Which had weighed upon your back

**4.** (4) And raised high for you your repute.

**5.** (5) For indeed, with hardship [will be] ease [i.e., relief].

**6.** (6) Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.

**7.** (7) So when you have finished [your duties], then stand up [for worship].

**8.** (8) And to your Lord direct [your] longing.
