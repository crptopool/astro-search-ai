description: Translation of Surah 77 - The Emissaries (Al-Mursalat)
---

**1.** (1) By those [winds] sent forth in gusts

**2.** (2) And the winds that blow violently

**3.** (3) And [by] the winds that spread [clouds]

**4.** (4) And those [angels] who bring criterion[1816]

**5.** (5) And those [angels] who deliver a message

**6.** (6) As justification or warning,

**7.** (7) Indeed, what you are promised is to occur.

**8.** (8) So when the stars are obliterated

**9.** (9) And when the heaven is opened

**10.** (10) And when the mountains are blown away

**11.** (11) And when the messengers' time has come...[1817]

**12.** (12) For what Day was it postponed?[1818]

**13.** (13) For the Day of Judgement.

**14.** (14) And what can make you know what is the Day of Judgement?

**15.** (15) Woe,[1819] that Day, to the deniers.

**16.** (16) Did We not destroy the former peoples?

**17.** (17) Then We will follow them with the later ones.

**18.** (18) Thus do We deal with the criminals.

**19.** (19) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**20.** (20) Did We not create you from a liquid disdained?

**21.** (21) And We placed it in a firm lodging [i.e., the womb]

**22.** (22) For a known extent.

**23.** (23) And We determined [it], and excellent [are We] to determine.

**24.** (24) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**25.** (25) Have We not made the earth a container

**26.** (26) Of the living and the dead?

**27.** (27) And We placed therein lofty, firmly set mountains and have given you to drink sweet water.

**28.** (28) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**29.** (29) [They will be told], "Proceed to that which you used to deny.

**30.** (30) Proceed to a shadow [of smoke] having three columns

**31.** (31) [But having] no cool shade and availing not against the flame."

**32.** (32) Indeed, it throws sparks [as huge] as a fortress,

**33.** (33) As if they were yellowish [black] camels.

**34.** (34) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**35.** (35) This is a Day they will not speak,

**36.** (36) Nor will it be permitted for them to make an excuse.

**37.** (37) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**38.** (38) This is the Day of Judgement; We will have assembled you and the former peoples.

**39.** (39) So if you have a plan, then plan against Me.

**40.** (40) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**41.** (41) Indeed, the righteous will be among shades and springs

**42.** (42) And fruits from whatever they desire,

**43.** (43) [Being told], "Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do."

**44.** (44) Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.

**45.** (45) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**46.** (46) [O disbelievers], eat and enjoy yourselves a little; indeed, you are criminals.

**47.** (47) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**48.** (48) And when it is said to them, "Bow [in prayer]," they do not bow.

**49.** (49) Woe, that Day, to the deniers.

**50.** (50) Then in what statement after it [i.e., the Qurï¿½?n] will they believe?
