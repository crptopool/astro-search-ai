description: Translation of Surah 107 - The Small kindnesses (Al-Ma'un)
---

**1.** (1) Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense?

**2.** (2) For that is the one who drives away the orphan

**3.** (3) And does not encourage the feeding of the poor.

**4.** (4) So woe to those who pray

**5.** (5) [But] who are heedless of their prayer[2000] -

**6.** (6) Those who make show [of their deeds]

**7.** (7) And withhold [simple] assistance.
