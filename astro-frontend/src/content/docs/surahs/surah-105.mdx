**1.** (1) Have you not considered, [O Mu?ammad], how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?[1992]

**2.** (2) Did He not make their plan into misguidance?[1993]

**3.** (3) And He sent against them birds in flocks,

**4.** (4) Striking them with stones of hard clay,

**5.** (5) And He made them like eaten straw.[1994]
