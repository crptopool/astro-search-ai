**1.** (1) When the Occurrence occurs,

**2.** (2) There is, at its occurrence, no denial.

**3.** (3) It will bring down [some] and raise up [others].[1608]

**4.** (4) When the earth is shaken with convulsion

**5.** (5) And the mountains are broken down, crumbling

**6.** (6) And become dust dispersing,

**7.** (7) And you become [of] three kinds:

**8.** (8) Then the companions of the right - what are the companions of the right?[1609]

**9.** (9) And the companions of the left - what are companions of the left?[1610]

**10.** (10) And the forerunners, the forerunners[1611] -

**11.** (11) Those are the ones brought near [to All?h]

**12.** (12) In the Gardens of Pleasure,

**13.** (13) A [large] company of the former peoples

**14.** (14) And a few of the later peoples,

**15.** (15) On thrones woven [with ornament],

**16.** (16) Reclining on them, facing each other.

**17.** (17) There will circulate among them young boys made eternal

**18.** (18) With vessels, pitchers and a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring -

**19.** (19) No headache will they have therefrom, nor will they be intoxicated -

**20.** (20) And fruit of what they select

**21.** (21) And the meat of fowl, from whatever they desire.

**22.** (22) And [for them are] fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes,

**23.** (23) The likenesses of pearls well-protected,

**24.** (24) As reward for what they used to do.

**25.** (25) They will not hear therein ill speech or commission of sin -

**26.** (26) Only a saying [of] peace, peace.

**27.** (27) The companions of the right - what are the companions of the right?

**28.** (28) [They will be] among lote trees with thorns removed

**29.** (29) And [banana] trees layered [with fruit]

**30.** (30) And shade extended

**31.** (31) And water poured out

**32.** (32) And fruit, abundant [and varied],

**33.** (33) Neither limited [to season] nor forbidden,

**34.** (34) And [upon] beds raised high.

**35.** (35) Indeed, We have produced them [i.e., the women of Paradise] in a [new] creation

**36.** (36) And made them virgins,

**37.** (37) Devoted [to their husbands] and of equal age,

**38.** (38) For the companions of the right [who are]

**39.** (39) A company of the former peoples

**40.** (40) And a company of the later peoples.

**41.** (41) And the companions of the left - what are the companions of the left?

**42.** (42) [They will be] in scorching fire and scalding water

**43.** (43) And a shade of black smoke,

**44.** (44) Neither cool nor beneficial.

**45.** (45) Indeed they were, before that, indulging in affluence,

**46.** (46) And they used to persist in the great violation,[1612]

**47.** (47) And they used to say, "When we die and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?

**48.** (48) And our forefathers [as well]?"

**49.** (49) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "Indeed, the former and later peoples

**50.** (50) Are to be gathered together for the appointment of a known Day."

**51.** (51) Then indeed you, O those astray [who are] deniers,

**52.** (52) Will be eating from trees of zaqq?m

**53.** (53) And filling with it your bellies

**54.** (54) And drinking on top of it from scalding water

**55.** (55) And will drink as the drinking of thirsty camels.

**56.** (56) That is their accommodation on the Day of Recompense.

**57.** (57) We have created you, so why do you not believe?

**58.** (58) Have you seen that which you emit?[1613]

**59.** (59) Is it you who creates it, or are We the Creator?

**60.** (60) We have decreed death among you, and We are not to be outdone

**61.** (61) In that We will change your likenesses and produce you in that [form] which you do not know.[1614]

**62.** (62) And you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember?

**63.** (63) And have you seen that [seed] which you sow?

**64.** (64) Is it you who makes it grow, or are We the grower?

**65.** (65) If We willed, We could make it [dry] debris, and you would remain in wonder,[1615]

**66.** (66) [Saying], "Indeed, we are [now] in debt;

**67.** (67) Rather, we have been deprived."

**68.** (68) And have you seen the water that you drink?

**69.** (69) Is it you who brought it down from the clouds, or is it We who bring it down?

**70.** (70) If We willed, We could make it bitter, so why are you not grateful?

**71.** (71) And have you seen the fire that you ignite?

**72.** (72) Is it you who produced its tree, or are We the producer?

**73.** (73) We have made it a reminder[1616] and provision for the travelers,[1617]

**74.** (74) So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great.

**75.** (75) Then I swear by the setting of the stars,[1618]

**76.** (76) And indeed, it is an oath - if you could know - [most] great.

**77.** (77) Indeed, it is a noble Qurï¿½?n.

**78.** (78) In a Register well-protected;[1619].

**79.** (79) None touch it except the purified [i.e., the angels].

**80.** (80) [It is] a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.

**81.** (81) Then is it to this statement that you are indifferent

**82.** (82) And make [the thanks for] your provision that you deny [the Provider]?

**83.** (83) Then why, when it [i.e., the soul at death] reaches the throat

**84.** (84) And you are at that time looking on -

**85.** (85) And We [i.e., Our angels] are nearer to him than you, but you do not see -

**86.** (86) Then why do you not, if you are not to be recompensed,

**87.** (87) Bring it back,[1620] if you should be truthful?

**88.** (88) And if he [i.e., the deceased] was of those brought near [to All?h],

**89.** (89) Then [for him is] rest and bounty and a garden of pleasure.

**90.** (90) And if he was of the companions of the right,

**91.** (91) Then [the angels will say], "Peace for you; [you are] from the companions of the right."

**92.** (92) But if he was of the deniers [who were] astray,

**93.** (93) Then [for him is] accommodation of scalding water

**94.** (94) And burning in Hellfire.

**95.** (95) Indeed, this is the true certainty,

**96.** (96) So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great.
