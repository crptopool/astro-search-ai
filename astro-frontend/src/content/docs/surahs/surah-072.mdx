description: Translation of Surah 72 - The Jinn (Al-Jinn)
---

**1.** (1) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur�?n [i.e., recitation].

**2.** (2) It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.

**3.** (3) And [it teaches] that exalted is the nobleness of our Lord; He has not taken a wife or a son

**4.** (4) And that our foolish one [i.e., Iblees][1766] has been saying about All?h an excessive transgression.

**5.** (5) And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about All?h a lie.

**6.** (6) And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn, so they [only] increased them in burden [i.e., sin].

**7.** (7) And they had thought, as you thought, that All?h would never send anyone [as a messenger].

**8.** (8) And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames.

**9.** (9) And we used to sit therein in positions for hearing,[1767] but whoever listens now will find a burning flame lying in wait for him.

**10.** (10) And we do not know [therefore] whether evil is intended for those on earth or whether their Lord intends for them a right course.

**11.** (11) And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.[1768]

**12.** (12) And we have become certain that we will never cause failure to All?h upon earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.

**13.** (13) And when we heard the guidance [i.e., the Qur�?n], we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear deprivation or burden.[1769]

**14.** (14) And among us are Muslims [in submission to All?h], and among us are the unjust.[1770] And whoever has become Muslim - those have sought out the right course.

**15.** (15) But as for the unjust, they will be, for Hell, firewood.'

**16.** (16) And [All?h revealed] that if they had remained straight on the way, We would have given them abundant rain [i.e., provision]

**17.** (17) So We might test them therein. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord[1771] He will put into arduous punishment.

**18.** (18) And [He revealed] that the masjids[1772] are for All?h, so do not invoke[1773] with All?h anyone.

**19.** (19) And that when the Servant [i.e., Prophet] of All?h stood up supplicating Him, they almost became about him a compacted mass."[1774]

**20.** (20) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "I only invoke my Lord and do not associate with Him anyone."

**21.** (21) Say, "Indeed, I do not possess for you [the power of] harm or right direction."

**22.** (22) Say, "Indeed, there will never protect me from All?h anyone [if I should disobey], nor will I find in other than Him a refuge.

**23.** (23) But [I have for you] only notification from All?h, and His messages." And whoever disobeys All?h and His Messenger - then indeed, for him is the fire of Hell; they will abide therein forever.

**24.** (24) [The disbelievers continue] until, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and less in number.

**25.** (25) Say, "I do not know if what you are promised is near or if my Lord will grant for it a [long] period."

**26.** (26) [He is] Knower of the unseen, and He does not disclose His [knowledge of the] unseen to anyone

**27.** (27) Except whom He has approved of messengers, and indeed, He sends before him [i.e., each messenger] and behind him observers[1775]

**28.** (28) That he [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] may know[1776] that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number.
