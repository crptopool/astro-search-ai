description: Translation of Surah 67 - The Sovereignty (Al-Mulk)
---

**1.** (1) Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent -

**2.** (2) [He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving -

**3.** (3) [And] who created seven heavens in layers.[1712] You do not see in the creation of the Most Merciful any inconsistency. So return [your] vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?

**4.** (4) Then return [your] vision twice again.[1713] [Your] vision will return to you humbled while it is fatigued.

**5.** (5) And We have certainly beautified the nearest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars] and have made [from] them what is thrown at the devils[1714] and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.

**6.** (6) And for those who disbelieved in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination.

**7.** (7) When they are thrown into it, they hear from it a [dreadful] inhaling while it boils up.

**8.** (8) It almost bursts with rage. Every time a company is thrown into it, its keepers ask them, "Did there not come to you a warner?"

**9.** (9) They will say, "Yes, a warner had come to us, but we denied and said, 'All?h has not sent down anything. You are not but in great error.'"

**10.** (10) And they will say, "If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze."

**11.** (11) And they will admit their sin, so [it is] alienation[1715] for the companions of the Blaze.

**12.** (12) Indeed, those who fear their Lord unseen will have forgiveness and great reward.

**13.** (13) And conceal your speech or publicize it; indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.

**14.** (14) Does He who created not know,[1716] while He is the Subtle, the Aware?

**15.** (15) It is He who made the earth tame[1717] for you - so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision - and to Him is the resurrection.

**16.** (16) Do you feel secure that He who is above[1718] would not cause the earth to swallow you and suddenly it would sway?[1719]

**17.** (17) Or do you feel secure that He who is above would not send against you a storm of stones? Then you would know how [severe] was My warning.

**18.** (18) And already had those before them denied, and how [terrible] was My reproach.

**19.** (19) Do they not see the birds above them with wings outspread and [sometimes] folded in? None holds them [aloft] except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is, of all things, Seeing.

**20.** (20) Or who is it that could be an army for you to aid you other than the Most Merciful? The disbelievers are not but in delusion.

**21.** (21) Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.

**22.** (22) Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path?

**23.** (23) Say, "It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful."

**24.** (24) Say, "It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered."

**25.** (25) And they say, "When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"

**26.** (26) Say, "The knowledge is only with All?h, and I am only a clear warner."

**27.** (27) But when they see it[1720] approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed, and it will be said, "This is that for which you used to call."[1721]

**28.** (28) Say, [O Mu?ammad], "Have you considered:[1722] whether All?h should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?"

**29.** (29) Say, "He is the Most Merciful; we have believed in Him, and upon Him we have relied. And you will [come to] know who it is that is in clear error."

**30.** (30) Say, "Have you considered: if your water was to become sunken [into the earth], then who could bring you flowing water?"
