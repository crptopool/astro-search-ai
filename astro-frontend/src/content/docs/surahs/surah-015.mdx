description: Translation of Surah 15 - The Rocky Tract (Al-Hijr)
---

**1.** (1) Alif, L?m, R?.[668] These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur�?n [i.e., recitation].

**2.** (2) Perhaps those who disbelieve will wish[669] that they had been Muslims.

**3.** (3) Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by [false] hope, for they are going to know.

**4.** (4) And We did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree.

**5.** (5) No nation will precede its term, nor will they remain thereafter.

**6.** (6) And they say, "O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad.[670]

**7.** (7) Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?"

**8.** (8) We do not send down the angels except with truth;[671] and they [i.e., the disbelievers] would not then be reprieved.

**9.** (9) Indeed, it is We who sent down the message [i.e., the Qur�?n], and indeed, We will be its guardian.

**10.** (10) And We had certainly sent [messengers] before you, [O Mu?ammad], among the sects of the former peoples.

**11.** (11) And no messenger would come to them except that they ridiculed him.

**12.** (12) Thus do We insert it [i.e., denial] into the hearts of the criminals.

**13.** (13) They will not believe in it, while there has already occurred the precedent of the former peoples.

**14.** (14) And [even] if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they continued therein to ascend,

**15.** (15) They would say, "Our eyes have only been dazzled. Rather, we are a people affected by magic."

**16.** (16) And We have placed within the heaven great stars and have beautified it for the observers.

**17.** (17) And We have protected it from every devil expelled [from the mercy of All?h]

**18.** (18) Except one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear burning flame.

**19.** (19) And the earth - We have spread it and cast therein firmly set mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every well-balanced thing.

**20.** (20) And We have made for you therein means of living and [for] those for whom you are not providers.[672]

**21.** (21) And there is not a thing but that with Us are its depositories, and We do not send it down except according to a known [i.e., specified] measure.

**22.** (22) And We have sent the fertilizing winds[673] and sent down water from the sky and given you drink from it. And you are not its retainers.

**23.** (23) And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor.[674]

**24.** (24) And We have already known the preceding [generations] among you, and We have already known the later [ones to come].

**25.** (25) And indeed, your Lord will gather them; indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.

**26.** (26) And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud.

**27.** (27) And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.

**28.** (28) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "I will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud.

**29.** (29) And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul,[675] then fall down to him in prostration."

**30.** (30) So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,

**31.** (31) Except Iblees;[676] he refused to be with those who prostrated.

**32.** (32) [All?h] said, "O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?"

**33.** (33) He said, "Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black mud."

**34.** (34) [All?h] said, "Then depart from it,[677] for indeed, you are expelled.

**35.** (35) And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Recompense."

**36.** (36) He said, "My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."

**37.** (37) [All?h] said, "So indeed, you are of those reprieved

**38.** (38) Until the Day of the time well-known."

**39.** (39) [Iblees] said, "My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them [i.e., mankind] on earth, and I will mislead them all

**40.** (40) Except, among them, Your chosen servants."

**41.** (41) [All?h] said, "This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.

**42.** (42) Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.

**43.** (43) And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.

**44.** (44) It has seven gates; for every gate is of them [i.e., Satan's followers] a portion designated."

**45.** (45) Indeed, the righteous will be within gardens and springs,

**46.** (46) [Having been told], "Enter it in peace, safe [and secure]."

**47.** (47) And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment,[678] [so they will be] brothers, on thrones facing each other.

**48.** (48) No fatigue will touch them therein, nor from it will they [ever] be removed.

**49.** (49) [O Mu?ammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful,

**50.** (50) And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment.

**51.** (51) And inform them about the guests of Abraham,

**52.** (52) When they entered upon him and said, "Peace." [Abraham] said, "Indeed, we are fearful [i.e., apprehensive] of you."

**53.** (53) [The angels] said, "Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy."

**54.** (54) He said, "Have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me? Then of what [wonder] do you inform?"

**55.** (55) They said, "We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing."

**56.** (56) He said, "And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?"

**57.** (57) [Abraham] said, "Then what is your business [here], O messengers?"

**58.** (58) They said, "Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,

**59.** (59) Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all

**60.** (60) Except his wife." We [i.e., All?h] decreed that she is of those who remain behind.[679]

**61.** (61) And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,

**62.** (62) He said, "Indeed, you are people unknown."

**63.** (63) They said, "But we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,

**64.** (64) And we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.

**65.** (65) So set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded."

**66.** (66) And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.

**67.** (67) And the people of the city came rejoicing.[680]

**68.** (68) [Lot] said, "Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.

**69.** (69) And fear All?h and do not disgrace me."

**70.** (70) They said, "Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?"

**71.** (71) [Lot] said, "These are my daughters[681] - if you would be doers [of lawful marriage]."

**72.** (72) By your life, [O Mu?ammad], indeed they were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly.

**73.** (73) So the shriek[682] seized them at sunrise.

**74.** (74) And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay.

**75.** (75) Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.

**76.** (76) And indeed, they [i.e., those cities] are [situated] on an established road.

**77.** (77) Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.

**78.** (78) And the companions of the thicket [i.e., the people of Madyan] were [also] wrongdoers,

**79.** (79) So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.

**80.** (80) And certainly did the companions of al-?ijr[683] [i.e., the Tham?d] deny the messengers.

**81.** (81) And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning away.

**82.** (82) And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling secure.

**83.** (83) But the shriek seized them at early morning,

**84.** (84) So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.

**85.** (85) And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.

**86.** (86) Indeed, your Lord - He is the Knowing Creator.

**87.** (87) And We have certainly given you, [O Mu?ammad], seven of the often repeated [verses][684] and the great Qur�?n.

**88.** (88) Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [certain] categories of them [i.e., the disbelievers], and do not grieve over them. And lower your wing [i.e., show kindness] to the believers.

**89.** (89) And say, "Indeed, I am the clear warner" -

**90.** (90) Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators[685]

**91.** (91) Who have made the Qur�?n into portions.[686]

**92.** (92) So by your Lord, We will surely question them all

**93.** (93) About what they used to do.

**94.** (94) Then declare what you are commanded[687] and turn away from the polytheists.[688]

**95.** (95) Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers

**96.** (96) Who make [equal] with All?h another deity. But they are going to know.

**97.** (97) And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say.

**98.** (98) So exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord and be of those who prostrate [to Him].

**99.** (99) And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty [i.e., death].
