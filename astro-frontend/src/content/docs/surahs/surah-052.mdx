**1.** (1) By the mount

**2.** (2) And [by] a Book inscribed[1550]

**3.** (3) In parchment spread open

**4.** (4) And [by] the frequented House[1551]

**5.** (5) And [by] the ceiling [i.e., heaven] raised high

**6.** (6) And [by] the sea set on fire,[1552]

**7.** (7) Indeed, the punishment of your Lord will occur.

**8.** (8) Of it there is no preventer.

**9.** (9) On the Day the heaven will sway with circular motion

**10.** (10) And the mountains will pass on, departing[1553] -

**11.** (11) Then woe, that Day, to the deniers,

**12.** (12) Who are in [empty] discourse amusing themselves.

**13.** (13) The Day they are thrust toward the fire of Hell with a [violent] thrust, [its angels will say],

**14.** (14) "This is the Fire which you used to deny.

**15.** (15) Then is this magic, or do you not see?

**16.** (16) [Enter to] burn therein; then be patient or impatient - it is all the same for you. You are only being recompensed [for] what you used to do."

**17.** (17) Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and pleasure,

**18.** (18) Enjoying what their Lord has given them, and their Lord protected them from the punishment of Hellfire.

**19.** (19) [They will be told], "Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you used to do."

**20.** (20) They will be reclining on thrones lined up, and We will marry them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes.

**21.** (21) And those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith - We will join with them their descendants, and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds.[1554] Every person, for what he earned, is retained.[1555]

**22.** (22) And We will provide them with fruit and meat from whatever they desire.

**23.** (23) They will exchange with one another a cup [of wine] wherein [results] no ill speech or commission of sin.

**24.** (24) There will circulate among them [servant] boys [especially] for them, as if they were pearls well-protected.

**25.** (25) And they will approach one another, inquiring of each other.

**26.** (26) They will say, "Indeed, we were previously among our people fearful [of displeasing All?h].

**27.** (27) So All?h conferred favor upon us and protected us from the punishment of the Scorching Fire.

**28.** (28) Indeed, we used to supplicate[1556] Him before. Indeed, it is He who is the Beneficent, the Merciful."

**29.** (29) So remind, [O Mu?ammad], for you are not, by the favor of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman.

**30.** (30) Or do they say [of you], "A poet for whom we await a misfortune of time"?[1557]

**31.** (31) Say, "Wait, for indeed I am, with you, among the waiters."

**32.** (32) Or do their minds[1558] command them to [say] this, or are they a transgressing people?

**33.** (33) Or do they say, "He has made it up"? Rather, they do not believe.

**34.** (34) Then let them produce a statement like it, if they should be truthful.

**35.** (35) Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]?

**36.** (36) Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain.

**37.** (37) Or have they the depositories [containing the provision] of your Lord? Or are they the controllers [of them]?

**38.** (38) Or have they a stairway [into the heaven] upon which they listen? Then let their listener produce a clear authority [i.e., proof].

**39.** (39) Or has He daughters while you have sons?

**40.** (40) Or do you, [O Mu?ammad], ask of them a payment, so they are by debt burdened down?

**41.** (41) Or have they [knowledge of] the unseen, so they write [it] down?

**42.** (42) Or do they intend a plan? But those who disbelieve - they are the object of a plan.

**43.** (43) Or have they a deity other than All?h? Exalted is All?h above whatever they associate with Him.

**44.** (44) And if they were to see a fragment from the sky falling,[1559] they would say, "[It is merely] clouds heaped up."

**45.** (45) So leave them until they meet their Day in which they will be struck insensible -

**46.** (46) The Day their plan will not avail them at all, nor will they be helped.

**47.** (47) And indeed, for those who have wronged is a punishment[1560] before that, but most of them do not know.

**48.** (48) And be patient, [O Mu?ammad], for the decision of your Lord, for indeed, you are in Our eyes [i.e., sight]. And exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord when you arise

**49.** (49) And in a part of the night exalt Him and after [the setting of] the stars.
