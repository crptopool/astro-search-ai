description: Translation of Surah 79 - Those who drag forth (An-Nazi'at)
---

**1.** (1) By those [angels] who extract with violence[1833]

**2.** (2) And [by] those who remove with ease[1834]

**3.** (3) And [by] those who glide [as if] swimming[1835]

**4.** (4) And those who race each other in a race[1836]

**5.** (5) And those who arrange [each] matter,[1837]

**6.** (6) On the Day the blast [of the Horn] will convulse [creation],

**7.** (7) There will follow it the subsequent [one].

**8.** (8) Hearts,[1838] that Day, will tremble,

**9.** (9) Their eyes[1839] humbled.

**10.** (10) They are [presently] saying, "Will we indeed be returned to [our] former state [of life]?

**11.** (11) Even if we should be decayed bones?"[1840]

**12.** (12) They say, "That, then, would be a losing return."[1841]

**13.** (13) Indeed, it will be but one shout,

**14.** (14) And suddenly they will be [alert] upon the earth's surface.

**15.** (15) Has there reached you the story of Moses? -

**16.** (16) When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of ?uw?,

**17.** (17) "Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.

**18.** (18) And say to him, 'Would you [be willing to] purify yourself

**19.** (19) And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?'"

**20.** (20) And he showed him the greatest sign,[1842]

**21.** (21) But he [i.e., Pharaoh] denied and disobeyed.

**22.** (22) Then he turned his back, striving [i.e., plotting].[1843]

**23.** (23) And he gathered [his people] and called out

**24.** (24) And said, "I am your most exalted lord."

**25.** (25) So All?h seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first [transgression].[1844].

**26.** (26) Indeed in that is a lesson [i.e., warning] for whoever would fear [All?h].

**27.** (27) Are you a more difficult creation or is the heaven? He [i.e., All?h] constructed it.

**28.** (28) He raised its ceiling and proportioned it.

**29.** (29) And He darkened its night and extracted its brightness.[1845]

**30.** (30) And after that He spread the earth.

**31.** (31) He extracted from it its water and its pasture,

**32.** (32) And the mountains He set firmly

**33.** (33) As enjoyment [i.e., provision] for you and your grazing livestock.

**34.** (34) But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity[1846] -

**35.** (35) The Day when man will remember that for which he strove,

**36.** (36) And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see -

**37.** (37) So as for he who transgressed

**38.** (38) And preferred the life of the world,

**39.** (39) Then indeed, Hellfire will be [his] refuge.

**40.** (40) But as for he who feared the position of his Lord[1847] and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination,

**41.** (41) Then indeed, Paradise will be [his] refuge.

**42.** (42) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about the Hour: when is its arrival?[1848]

**43.** (43) In what [position] are you that you should mention it?[1849]

**44.** (44) To your Lord is its finality.[1850]

**45.** (45) You are only a warner for those who fear it.

**46.** (46) It will be, on the Day they see it,[1851] as though they had not remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning thereof.
