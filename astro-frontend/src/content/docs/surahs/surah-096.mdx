---

**1.** (1) Recite in the name of your Lord who created �

**2.** (2) Created man from a clinging substance.

**3.** (3) Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous -

**4.** (4) Who taught by the pen �

**5.** (5) Taught man that which he knew not.

**6.** (6) No! [But] indeed, man transgresses

**7.** (7) Because he sees himself self-sufficient.

**8.** (8) Indeed, to your Lord is the return.

**9.** (9) Have you seen the one who forbids

**10.** (10) A servant when he prays?

**11.** (11) Have you seen if he is upon guidance

**12.** (12) Or enjoins righteousness?

**13.** (13) Have you seen if he denies and turns away -

**14.** (14) Does he not know that All?h sees?

**15.** (15) No! If he does not desist, We will surely drag him by the forelock[1952] �

**16.** (16) A lying, sinning forelock.

**17.** (17) Then let him call his associates;

**18.** (18) We will call the angels of Hell.[1953]

**19.** (19) No! Do not obey him. But prostrate and draw near [to All?h].
