description: Translation of Surah 78 - The Tidings (An-Naba)
---

**1.** (1) About what are they asking one another?

**2.** (2) About the great news[1821] -

**3.** (3) That over which they are in disagreement.

**4.** (4) No! They are going to know.

**5.** (5) Then, no! They are going to know.

**6.** (6) Have We not made the earth a resting place?

**7.** (7) And the mountains as stakes?[1822]

**8.** (8) And We created you in pairs

**9.** (9) And made your sleep [a means for] rest

**10.** (10) And made the night as clothing[1823]

**11.** (11) And made the day for livelihood

**12.** (12) And constructed above you seven strong [heavens]

**13.** (13) And made [therein] a burning lamp

**14.** (14) And sent down from the rain clouds pouring water

**15.** (15) That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation

**16.** (16) And gardens of entwined growth.

**17.** (17) Indeed, the Day of Judgement is an appointed time -

**18.** (18) The Day the Horn is blown and you will come forth in multitudes

**19.** (19) And the heaven is opened and will become gateways

**20.** (20) And the mountains are removed and will be [but] a mirage.

**21.** (21) Indeed, Hell has been lying in wait

**22.** (22) For the transgressors, a place of return,

**23.** (23) In which they will remain for ages [unending].

**24.** (24) They will not taste therein [any] coolness or drink.

**25.** (25) Except scalding water and [foul] purulence -

**26.** (26) An appropriate recompense.[1824]

**27.** (27) Indeed, they were not expecting an account

**28.** (28) And denied Our verses with [emphatic] denial.

**29.** (29) But all things We have enumerated in writing.

**30.** (30) "So taste [the penalty], and never will We increase you except in torment."[1825]

**31.** (31) Indeed, for the righteous is attainment[1826] -

**32.** (32) Gardens and grapevines

**33.** (33) And young women [companions] of equal age.

**34.** (34) And a full cup.[1827]

**35.** (35) No ill speech will they hear therein or any falsehood -

**36.** (36) [As] reward from your Lord, [a generous] gift [made due by] account,[1828]

**37.** (37) [From] the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Most Merciful. They possess not from Him [authority for] speech.[1829]

**38.** (38) The Day that the Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] and the angels will stand in rows, they will not speak except for one whom the Most Merciful permits, and he will say what is correct.

**39.** (39) That is the True [i.e., certain] Day; so he who wills may take to his Lord a [way of] return.[1830]

**40.** (40) Indeed, We have warned you of an impending punishment on the Day when a man will observe what his hands have put forth[1831] and the disbeliever will say, "Oh, I wish that I were dust!"
