description: Translation of Surah 85 - The Mansions of the Stars (Al-Buruj)
---

**1.** (1) By the sky containing great stars

**2.** (2) And [by] the promised Day

**3.** (3) And [by] the witness and what is witnessed,

**4.** (4) Destroyed [i.e., cursed] were the companions of the trench[1895]

**5.** (5) [Containing] the fire full of fuel,

**6.** (6) When they were sitting near it.

**7.** (7) And they, to what they were doing against the believers, were witnesses. [1896]

**8.** (8) And they resented them not except because they believed in All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy,

**9.** (9) To whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And All?h, over all things, is Witness.[1897]

**10.** (10) Indeed, those who have tortured[1898] the believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire.

**11.** (11) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great attainment.

**12.** (12) Indeed, the assault [i.e., vengeance] of your Lord is severe.

**13.** (13) Indeed, it is He who originates [creation] and repeats.

**14.** (14) And He is the Forgiving, the Affectionate,

**15.** (15) Honorable Owner of the Throne,

**16.** (16) Effecter of what He intends.

**17.** (17) Has there reached you the story of the soldiers -

**18.** (18) [Those of] Pharaoh and Tham?d?

**19.** (19) But they who disbelieve are in [persistent] denial,

**20.** (20) While All?h encompasses them from behind.[1899]

**21.** (21) But this is an honored Qurï¿½?n

**22.** (22) [Inscribed] in a Preserved Slate.
