description: Translation of Surah 80 - He Frowned (Abasa)
---

**1.** (1) He [i.e., the Prophet (?) ] frowned and turned away

**2.** (2) Because there came to him the blind man,[1853] [interrupting].

**3.** (3) But what would make you perceive, [O Mu?ammad], that perhaps he might be purified[1854]

**4.** (4) Or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him?

**5.** (5) As for he who thinks himself without need,[1855]

**6.** (6) To him you give attention.

**7.** (7) And not upon you [is any blame] if he will not be purified.[1856]

**8.** (8) But as for he who came to you striving [for knowledge]

**9.** (9) While he fears [All?h],

**10.** (10) From him you are distracted.

**11.** (11) No! Indeed, they [i.e., these verses] are a reminder;

**12.** (12) So whoever wills may remember it.[1857]

**13.** (13) [It is recorded] in honored sheets,

**14.** (14) Exalted and purified,

**15.** (15) [Carried] by the hands of messenger-angels,

**16.** (16) Noble and dutiful.

**17.** (17) Destroyed [i.e., cursed] is man;[1858] how disbelieving is he.

**18.** (18) From what thing [i.e., substance] did He create him?

**19.** (19) From a sperm-drop He created him and destined for him;[1859]

**20.** (20) Then He eased the way for him;[1860]

**21.** (21) Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him.[1861]

**22.** (22) Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.

**23.** (23) No! He [i.e., man] has not yet accomplished what He commanded him.

**24.** (24) Then let mankind look at his food -

**25.** (25) How We poured down water in torrents,

**26.** (26) Then We broke open the earth, splitting [it with sprouts],

**27.** (27) And caused to grow within it grain

**28.** (28) And grapes and herbage

**29.** (29) And olive and palm trees

**30.** (30) And gardens of dense shrubbery

**31.** (31) And fruit and grass -

**32.** (32) [As] enjoyment [i.e., provision] for you and your grazing livestock.

**33.** (33) But when there comes the Deafening Blast[1862]

**34.** (34) On the Day a man will flee from his brother

**35.** (35) And his mother and his father

**36.** (36) And his wife and his children,

**37.** (37) For every man, that Day, will be a matter adequate for him.[1863]

**38.** (38) [Some] faces, that Day, will be bright -

**39.** (39) Laughing, rejoicing at good news.

**40.** (40) And [other] faces, that Day, will have upon them dust.

**41.** (41) Blackness will cover them.

**42.** (42) Those are the disbelievers, the wicked ones.
