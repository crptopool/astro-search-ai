**1.** (1) Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, [saying], "Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment."

**2.** (2) He said, "O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner -

**3.** (3) To worship All?h, fear Him and obey me.

**4.** (4) He [i.e., All?h] will forgive you of your sins and delay you for a specified term. Indeed, the time [set by] All?h, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew."

**5.** (5) He said, "My Lord, indeed I invited my people [to truth] night and day.

**6.** (6) But my invitation increased them not except in flight [i.e., aversion].

**7.** (7) And indeed, every time I invited them that You may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments,[1761] persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance.

**8.** (8) Then I invited them publicly.

**9.** (9) Then I announced to them and [also] confided to them secretly

**10.** (10) And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.

**11.** (11) He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers

**12.** (12) And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.

**13.** (13) What is [the matter] with you that you do not attribute to All?h [due] grandeur

**14.** (14) While He has created you in stages?[1762]

**15.** (15) Do you not consider how All?h has created seven heavens in layers[1763]

**16.** (16) And made the moon therein a [reflected] light and made the sun a burning lamp?

**17.** (17) And All?h has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth.

**18.** (18) Then He will return you into it and extract you [another] extraction.

**19.** (19) And All?h has made for you the earth an expanse

**20.** (20) That you may follow therein roads of passage.'"

**21.** (21) Noah said, "My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children will not increase him except in loss.

**22.** (22) And they conspired an immense conspiracy

**23.** (23) And said, 'Never leave your gods and never leave Wadd or Suw?? or Yagh?th and Ya??q and Nasr.'[1764]

**24.** (24) And already they have misled many. And, [my Lord], do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."

**25.** (25) Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire, and they found not for themselves besides All?h [any] helpers.

**26.** (26) And Noah said, "My Lord, do not leave upon the earth from among the disbelievers an inhabitant.

**27.** (27) Indeed, if You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and not beget except [every] wicked one and [confirmed] disbeliever.

**28.** (28) My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction."
