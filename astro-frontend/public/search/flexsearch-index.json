    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, Meem.[7]\n\n**10** (10) In their hearts is disease, so All?h has increased their disease;[13] and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie.\n\n**100** (100) Is it not [true] that every time they took a covenant a party of them threw it away? But, [in fact], most of them do not believe.\n\n**101** (101) And when a messenger from All?h came to them confirming that which was with them, a party of those who had been given the Scripture threw the Scripture of All?h [i.e., the Torah] behind their backs as if they did not know [what it contained].\n\n**102** (102) And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, H?r?t and M?r?t. But they [i.e., the two angels] do not teach anyone unless they say, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].\"[34] And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of All?h. And they [i.e., people] learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But they [i.e., the Children of Israel] certainly knew that whoever purchased it [i.e., magic] would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.\n\n**103** (103) And if they had believed and feared All?h, then the reward from All?h would have been [far] better, if they only knew.\n\n**104** (104) O you who have believed, say not [to All?h's Messenger], \"R??in?\" but say, \"Un?urn?\"[35] and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.\n\n**105** (105) Neither those who disbelieve from the People of the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and Christians] nor the polytheists wish that any good should be sent down to you from your Lord. But All?h selects for His mercy whom He wills, and All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**106** (106) We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that All?h is over all things competent?\n\n**107** (107) Do you not know that to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and [that] you have not besides All?h any protector or any helper?\n\n**108** (108) Or do you intend to ask[36] your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\n\n**109** (109) Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [even] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until All?h delivers His command. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**11** (11) And when it is said to them, \"Do not cause corruption on the earth,\" they say, \"We are but reformers.\"\n\n**110** (110) And establish prayer and give zak?h, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with All?h. Indeed All?h, of what you do, is Seeing.\n\n**111** (111) And they say, \"None will enter Paradise except one who is a Jew or a Christian.\" That is [merely] their wishful thinking. Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**112** (112) Yes, [on the contrary], whoever submits his face [i.e., self] in Isl?m to All?h while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**113** (113) The Jews say, \"The Christians have nothing [true] to stand on,\" and the Christians say, \"The Jews have nothing to stand on,\" although they [both] recite the Scripture. Thus do those who know not [i.e., the polytheists] speak the same as their words. But All?h will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\n\n**114** (114) And who are more unjust than those who prevent the name of All?h from being mentioned [i.e., praised] in His mosques and strive toward their destruction. It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and they will have in the Hereafter a great punishment.\n\n**115** (115) And to All?h belongs the east and the west. So wherever you [might] turn, there is the Face[37] of All?h. Indeed, All?h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\n\n**116** (116) They say, \"All?h has taken a son.\" Exalted is He![38] Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are devoutly obedient to Him,\n\n**117** (117) Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n**118** (118) Those who do not know say, \"Why does All?h not speak to us or there come to us a sign?\" Thus spoke those before them like their words. Their hearts resemble each other. We have shown clearly the signs to a people who are certain [in faith].\n\n**119** (119) Indeed, We have sent you, [O Mu?ammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and you will not be asked about the companions of Hellfire.\n\n**12** (12) Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not.\n\n**120** (120) And never will the Jews and the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion. Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of All?h is the [only] guidance.\" If you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against All?h no protector or helper.\n\n**121** (121) Those to whom We have given the Book recite it with its true recital.[39] They [are the ones who] believe in it. And whoever disbelieves in it - it is they who are the losers.\n\n**122** (122) O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.\n\n**123** (123) And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul[40] at all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.\n\n**124** (124) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Abraham was tried by his Lord with words [i.e., commands] and he fulfilled them. [All?h] said, \"Indeed, I will make you a leader for the people.\" [Abraham] said, \"And of my descendants?\" [All?h] said, \"My covenant does not include the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**125** (125) And [mention] when We made the House [i.e., the Ka?bah] a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], \"Purify My House for those who perform ?aw?f[41] and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer].\"\n\n**126** (126) And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in All?h and the Last Day.\" [All?h] said, \"And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination.\"\n\n**127** (127) And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], \"Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing,[42] the Knowing.[43]\n\n**128** (128) Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a Muslim nation [in submission] to You. And show us our rites [of worship] and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Accepting of Repentance, the Merciful.\n\n**129** (129) Our Lord, and send among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might,[44] the Wise.\"\n\n**13** (13) And when it is said to them, \"Believe as the people have believed,\" they say, \"Should we believe as the foolish have believed?\" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not.\n\n**130** (130) And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself. And We had chosen him in this world, and indeed he, in the Hereafter, will be among the righteous.\n\n**131** (131) When his Lord said to him, \"Submit,\" he said, \"I have submitted [in Isl?m][45] to the Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**132** (132) And Abraham instructed his sons [to do the same] and [so did] Jacob, [saying], \"O my sons, indeed All?h has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims.\"\n\n**133** (133) Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after me?\" They said, \"We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac - one God.[46] And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"\n\n**134** (134) That was a nation which has passed on. It will have [the consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do.\n\n**135** (135) They say, \"Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided.\" Say, \"Rather, [we follow] the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists.\"[47]\n\n**136** (136) Say, [O believers], \"We have believed in All?h and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants [al-Asb??][48] and what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"\n\n**137** (137) So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they have been [rightly] guided; but if they turn away, they are only in dissension, and All?h will be sufficient for you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**138** (138) [And say, \"Ours is] the religion of All?h. And who is better than All?h in [ordaining] religion? And we are worshippers of Him.\"\n\n**139** (139) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Do you argue with us about All?h while He is our Lord and your Lord? For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. And we are sincere [in deed and intention] to Him.\"\n\n**14** (14) And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We believe\"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, \"Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers.\"\n\n**140** (140) Or do you say that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants were Jews or Christians? Say, \"Are you more knowing or is All?h?\" And who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony[49] he has from All?h? And All?h is not unaware of what you do.\n\n**141** (141) That is a nation which has passed on. It will have [the consequence of] what it earned, and you will have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do.\n\n**142** (142) The foolish among the people will say, \"What has turned them away from their qiblah,[50] which they used to face?\"[51] Say, \"To All?h belongs the east and the west. He guides whom He wills to a straight path.\"\n\n**143** (143) And thus We have made you a median [i.e., just] community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who would follow the Messenger from who would turn back on his heels.[52] And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom All?h has guided. And never would All?h have caused you to lose your faith [i.e., your previous prayers]. Indeed All?h is, to the people, Kind and Merciful.\n\n**144** (144) We have certainly seen the turning of your face, [O Mu?ammad], toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face [i.e., yourself] toward al-Masjid al-?ar?m.[53] And wherever you [believers] are, turn your faces [i.e., yourselves] toward it [in prayer]. Indeed, those who have been given the Scripture [i.e., the Jews and the Christians] well know that it is the truth from their Lord. And All?h is not unaware of what they do.\n\n**145** (145) And if you brought to those who were given the Scripture every sign, they would not follow your qiblah. Nor will you be a follower of their qiblah. Nor would they be followers of one another's qiblah. So if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers.\n\n**146** (146) Those to whom We gave the Scripture know him [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] as they know their own sons. But indeed, a party of them conceal the truth while they know [it].\n\n**147** (147) The truth is from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.\n\n**148** (148) For each [religious following] is a [prayer] direction toward which it faces. So race to [all that is] good. Wherever you may be, All?h will bring you forth [for judgement] all together. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**149** (149) So from wherever you go out [for prayer, O Mu?ammad], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-?ar?m, and indeed, it is the truth from your Lord. And All?h is not unaware of what you do.\n\n**15** (15) [But] All?h mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly.\n\n**150** (150) And from wherever you go out [for prayer], turn your face toward al-Masjid al-?ar?m. And wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces toward it in order that the people will not have any argument against you, except for those of them who commit wrong; so fear them not but fear Me. And [it is] so I may complete My favor upon you and that you may be guided,\n\n**151** (151) Just as We have sent among you a messenger from yourselves reciting to you Our verses and purifying you and teaching you the Book and wisdom[54] and teaching you that which you did not know.\n\n**152** (152) So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.\n\n**153** (153) O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, All?h is with the patient.\n\n**154** (154) And do not say about those who are killed in the way of All?h, \"They are dead.\" Rather, they are alive, but you perceive [it] not.\n\n**155** (155) And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,\n\n**156** (156) Who, when disaster strikes them, say, \"Indeed we belong to All?h, and indeed to Him we will return.\"\n\n**157** (157) Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.\n\n**158** (158) Indeed, a?-?af? and al-Marwah are among the symbols[55] of All?h. So whoever makes ?ajj [pilgrimage] to the House or performs ?umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them.[56] And whoever volunteers good - then indeed, All?h is Appreciative[57] and Knowing.\n\n**159** (159) Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by All?h and cursed by those who curse,[58]\n\n**16** (16) Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.\n\n**160** (160) Except for those who repent and correct themselves and make evident [what they concealed]. Those - I will accept their repentance, and I am the Accepting of Repentance,[59] the Merciful.\n\n**161** (161) Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them will be the curse of All?h and of the angels and the people, all together,\n\n**162** (162) Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.\n\n**163** (163) And your god is one God. There is no deity [worthy of worship] except Him, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.\n\n**164** (164) Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people, and what All?h has sent down from the heavens of rain, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature, and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and earth are signs for a people who use reason.\n\n**165** (165) And [yet], among the people are those who take other than All?h as equals [to Him]. They love them as they [should] love All?h. But those who believe are stronger in love for All?h. And if only they who have wronged would consider [that] when they see the punishment, [they will be certain] that all power belongs to All?h and that All?h is severe in punishment.\n\n**166** (166) [And they should consider that] when those who have been followed disassociate themselves from those who followed [them], and they [all] see the punishment, and cut off from them are the ties [of relationship],\n\n**167** (167) Those who followed will say, \"If only we had another turn [at worldly life] so we could disassociate ourselves from them as they have disassociated themselves from us.\" Thus will All?h show them their deeds as regrets upon them. And they are never to emerge from the Fire.\n\n**168** (168) O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.\n\n**169** (169) He only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about All?h what you do not know.\n\n**17** (17) Their example is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, All?h took away their light and left them in darkness [so] they could not see.\n\n**170** (170) And when it is said to them, \"Follow what All?h has revealed,\" they say, \"Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.\" Even though their fathers understood nothing, nor were they guided?\n\n**171** (171) The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries [i.e., cattle or sheep] - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.\n\n**172** (172) O you who have believed, eat from the good [i.e., lawful] things which We have provided for you and be grateful to All?h if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.\n\n**173** (173) He has only forbidden to you dead animals,[60] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All?h. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**174** (174) Indeed, they who conceal what All?h has sent down of the Book and exchange it for a small price - those consume not into their bellies except the Fire. And All?h will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**175** (175) Those are the ones who have exchanged guidance for error and forgiveness for punishment. How patient they are for [i.e., in pursuit of] the Fire!\n\n**176** (176) That is [deserved by them] because All?h has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book are in extreme dissension.\n\n**177** (177) Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but [true] righteousness is [in] one who believes in All?h, the Last Day, the angels, the Book, and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for it, to relatives, orphans, the needy, the traveler, those who ask [for help], and for freeing slaves; [and who] establishes prayer and gives zak?h; [those who] fulfill their promise when they promise; and [those who] are patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.\n\n**178** (178) O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.[61] But whoever overlooks from his brother [i.e., the killer] anything,[62] then there should be a suitable follow-up and payment to him [i.e., the deceased's heir or legal representative] with good conduct. This is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that[63] will have a painful punishment.\n\n**179** (179) And there is for you in legal retribution [saving of] life, O you [people] of understanding, that you may become righteous.[64]\n\n**18** (18) Deaf, dumb and blind - so they will not return [to the right path].\n\n**180** (180) Prescribed for you when death approaches [any] one of you if he leaves wealth [is that he should make] a bequest for the parents and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.[65]\n\n**181** (181) Then whoever alters it [i.e., the bequest] after he has heard it - the sin is only upon those who have altered it. Indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**182** (182) But if one fears from the bequeather [some] error or sin and corrects that which is between them [i.e., the concerned parties], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**183** (183) O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous -\n\n**184** (184) [Fasting for] a limited number of days. So whoever among you is ill or on a journey [during them] - then an equal number of other days [are to be made up]. And upon those who are able [to fast, but with hardship] - a ransom [as substitute] of feeding a poor person [each day]. And whoever volunteers good [i.e., excess] - it is better for him. But to fast is best for you, if you only knew.\n\n**185** (185) The month of Rama??n [is that] in which was revealed the Qur�?n, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the crescent of] the month,[66] let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. All?h intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify All?h for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**186** (186) And when My servants ask you, [O Mu?ammad], concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.\n\n**187** (187) It has been made permissible for you the night preceding fasting to go to your wives [for sexual relations]. They are a clothing for you and you are a clothing[67] for them. All?h knows that you used to deceive yourselves,[68] so He accepted your repentance and forgave you. So now, have relations with them and seek that which All?h has decreed for you [i.e., offspring]. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the night [i.e., sunset]. And do not have relations with them as long as you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits [set by] All?h, so do not approach them. Thus does All?h make clear His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that they may become righteous.\n\n**188** (188) And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order that [they might aid] you [to] consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin, while you know [it is unlawful].\n\n**189** (189) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about the crescent moons. Say, \"They are measurements of time for the people and for ?ajj [pilgrimage].\" And it is not righteousness to enter houses from the back, but righteousness is [in] one who fears All?h. And enter houses from their doors. And fear All?h that you may succeed.\n\n**19** (19) Or [it is] like a rainstorm from the sky within which is darkness, thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears against the thunderclaps in dread of death. But All?h is encompassing[14] of the disbelievers.\n\n**190** (190) Fight in the way of All?h those who fight against you but do not transgress. Indeed, All?h does not like transgressors.\n\n**191** (191) And kill them [in battle] wherever you overtake them and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah[69] is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al-?ar?m until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.\n\n**192** (192) And if they cease, then indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**193** (193) Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] religion [i.e., worship] is [acknowledged to be] for All?h. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression [i.e., assault] except against the oppressors.\n\n**194** (194) [Battle in] the sacred month is for [aggression committed in] the sacred month,[70] and for [all] violations is legal retribution. So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you. And fear All?h and know that All?h is with those who fear Him.\n\n**195** (195) And spend in the way of All?h and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, All?h loves the doers of good.\n\n**196** (196) And complete the ?ajj and ?umrah for All?h. But if you are prevented, then [offer] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached its place of slaughter. And whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [making shaving necessary must offer] a ransom of fasting [three days] or charity[71] or sacrifice.[72] And when you are secure,[73] then whoever performs ?umrah [during the ?ajj months][74] followed by ?ajj [offers] what can be obtained with ease of sacrificial animals. And whoever cannot find [or afford such an animal] - then a fast of three days during ?ajj and of seven when you have returned [home]. Those are ten complete [days]. This is for those whose family is not in the area of al-Masjid al-?ar?m. And fear All?h and know that All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**197** (197) ?ajj is [during] well-known months,[75] so whoever has made ?ajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of i?r?m], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during ?ajj. And whatever good you do - All?h knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of All?h. And fear Me, O you of understanding.\n\n**198** (198) There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty[76] from your Lord [during ?ajj]. But when you depart from ?Araf?t, remember All?h at al-Mash?ar al-?ar?m.[77] And remember Him, as He has guided you, for indeed, you were before that among those astray.\n\n**199** (199) Then depart from the place from where [all] the people depart and ask forgiveness of All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**2** (2) This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of All?h[8] -\n\n**20** (20) The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if All?h had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**200** (200) And when you have completed your rites, remember All?h like your [previous] remembrance of your fathers or with [much] greater remembrance. And among the people is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world,\" and he will have in the Hereafter no share.\n\n**201** (201) But among them is he who says, \"Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\"\n\n**202** (202) Those will have a share of what they have earned, and All?h is swift in account.\n\n**203** (203) And remember All?h during [specific] numbered days. Then whoever hastens [his departure] in two days - there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays [until the third] - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears All?h. And fear All?h and know that unto Him you will be gathered.\n\n**204** (204) And of the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life, and he calls All?h to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the fiercest of opponents.\n\n**205** (205) And when he goes away, he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals. And All?h does not like corruption.\n\n**206** (206) And when it is said to him, \"Fear All?h,\" pride in the sin takes hold of him. Sufficient for him is Hellfire, and how wretched is the resting place.\n\n**207** (207) And of the people is he who sells himself, seeking means to the approval of All?h. And All?h is Kind to [His] servants.\n\n**208** (208) O you who have believed, enter into Isl?m completely [and perfectly] and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.\n\n**209** (209) But if you slip [i.e., deviate] after clear proofs have come to you, then know that All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**21** (21) O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous -\n\n**210** (210) Do they await but that All?h should come to them in covers of clouds and the angels [as well] and the matter is [then] decided? And to All?h [all] matters are returned.\n\n**211** (211) Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign of evidence We have given them. And whoever exchanges the favor of All?h [for disbelief] after it has come to him - then indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**212** (212) Beautified for those who disbelieve is the life of this world, and they ridicule those who believe. But those who fear All?h are above them on the Day of Resurrection. And All?h gives provision to whom He wills without account.\n\n**213** (213) Mankind was [of] one religion [before their deviation]; then All?h sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners and sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed. And none differed over it [i.e., the Scripture] except those who were given it - after the clear proofs came to them - out of jealous animosity among themselves. And All?h guided those who believed to the truth concerning that over which they had differed, by His permission. And All?h guides whom He wills to a straight path.\n\n**214** (214) Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were touched by poverty and hardship and were shaken until [even their] messenger and those who believed with him said, \"When is the help of All?h?\" Unquestionably, the help of All?h is near.\n\n**215** (215) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], what they should spend. Say, \"Whatever you spend of good is [to be] for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler. And whatever you do of good - indeed, All?h is Knowing of it.\"\n\n**216** (216) Battle has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And All?h knows, while you know not.\n\n**217** (217) They ask you about the sacred month[78] - about fighting therein. Say, \"Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of All?h and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] al-Masjid al-?ar?m and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of All?h. And fitnah[79] is greater than killing.\" And they will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**218** (218) Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and fought in the cause of All?h - those expect the mercy of All?h. And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**219** (219) They ask you about wine[80] and gambling. Say, \"In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.\" And they ask you what they should spend. Say, \"The excess [beyond needs].\" Thus All?h makes clear to you the verses [of revelation] that you might give thought\n\n**22** (22) [He] who made for you the earth a bed [spread out] and the sky a ceiling and sent down from the sky, rain and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to All?h equals while you know [that there is nothing similar to Him].\n\n**220** (220) To this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you about orphans. Say, \"Improvement for them is best. And if you mix your affairs with theirs - they are your brothers. And All?h knows the corrupter from the amender. And if All?h had willed, He could have put you in difficulty. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"\n\n**221** (221) And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe.[81] And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist, even though she might please you. And do not marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist, even though he might please you. Those invite [you] to the Fire, but All?h invites to Paradise and to forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses [i.e., ordinances] to the people that perhaps they may remember.\n\n**222** (222) And they ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is harm, so keep away from wives[82] during menstruation. And do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves,[83] then come to them from where All?h has ordained for you. Indeed, All?h loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\"\n\n**223** (223) Your wives are a place of cultivation [i.e., sowing of seed] for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves. And fear All?h and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers.\n\n**224** (224) And do not make [your oath by] All?h an excuse against being righteous and fearing All?h and making peace among people. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**225** (225) All?h does not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He imposes blame upon you for what your hearts have earned. And All?h is Forgiving and Forbearing.[84]\n\n**226** (226) For those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives[85] is a waiting time of four months, but if they return [to normal relations] - then indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**227** (227) And if they decide on divorce - then indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**228** (228) Divorced women remain in waiting [i.e., do not remarry] for three periods,[86] and it is not lawful for them to conceal what All?h has created in their wombs if they believe in All?h and the Last Day. And their husbands have more right to take them back in this [period] if they want reconciliation.[87] And due to them [i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.[88] But the men [i.e., husbands] have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**229** (229) Divorce is twice. Then [after that], either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep [within] the limits of All?h.[89] But if you fear that they will not keep [within] the limits of All?h, then there is no blame upon either of them concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of All?h, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of All?h - it is those who are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\n\n**23** (23) And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down [i.e., the Qur�?n] upon Our Servant [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)], then produce a s?rah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses [i.e., supporters] other than All?h, if you should be truthful.\n\n**230** (230) And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him.[90] And if he [i.e., the latter husband] divorces her [or dies], there is no blame upon them [i.e., the woman and her former husband] for returning to each other if they think that they can keep [within] the limits of All?h. These are the limits of All?h, which He makes clear to a people who know [i.e.,understand].\n\n**231** (231) And when you divorce women and they have [nearly] fulfilled their term, either retain them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms, and do not keep them, intending harm, to transgress [against them]. And whoever does that has certainly wronged himself. And do not take the verses of All?h in jest. And remember the favor of All?h upon you and what has been revealed to you of the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] and wisdom [i.e., the Prophet's sunnah] by which He instructs you. And fear All?h and know that All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**232** (232) And when you divorce women[91] and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they [i.e., all parties] agree among themselves on an acceptable basis. That is instructed to whoever of you believes in All?h and the Last Day. That is better for you and purer, and All?h knows and you know not.\n\n**233** (233) Mothers may nurse [i.e., breastfeed] their children two complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing [period]. Upon the father is their [i.e., the mothers'] provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable. No person is charged with more than his capacity. No mother should be harmed through her child, and no father through his child. And upon the [father's] heir is [a duty] like that [of the father]. And if they both desire weaning through mutual consent from both of them and consultation, there is no blame upon either of them. And if you wish to have your children nursed by a substitute, there is no blame upon you as long as you give payment according to what is acceptable. And fear All?h and know that All?h is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**234** (234) And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - they, [the wives, shall] wait four months and ten [days]. And when they have fulfilled their term, then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner.[92] And All?h is [fully] Aware of what you do.\n\n**235** (235) There is no blame upon you for that to which you [indirectly] allude concerning a proposal to women or for what you conceal within yourselves. All?h knows that you will have them in mind. But do not promise them secretly except for saying a proper saying. And do not determine to undertake a marriage contract until the decreed period[93] reaches its end. And know that All?h knows what is within yourselves, so beware of Him. And know that All?h is Forgiving and Forbearing.\n\n**236** (236) There is no blame upon you if you divorce women you have not touched[94] nor specified for them an obligation.[95] But give them [a gift of] compensation - the wealthy according to his capability and the poor according to his capability - a provision according to what is acceptable, a duty upon the doers of good.\n\n**237** (237) And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them an obligation, then [give] half of what you specified - unless they forego the right or the one in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. And to forego it is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed All?h, of whatever you do, is Seeing.\n\n**238** (238) Maintain with care the [obligatory] prayers and [in particular] the middle [i.e., ?a?r] prayer and stand before All?h, devoutly obedient.\n\n**239** (239) And if you fear [an enemy, then pray] on foot or riding. But when you are secure, then remember All?h [in prayer], as He has taught you that which you did not [previously] know.\n\n**24** (24) But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire, whose fuel is people and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.\n\n**240** (240) And those who are taken in death among you and leave wives behind - for their wives is a bequest: maintenance for one year without turning [them] out. But if they leave [of their own accord], then there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable way.[96] And All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**241** (241) And for divorced women is a provision according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous.\n\n**242** (242) Thus does All?h make clear to you His verses [i.e., laws] that you might use reason.\n\n**243** (243) Have you not considered those who left their homes in many thousands, fearing death? All?h said to them, \"Die\"; then He restored them to life. And All?h is the possessor of bounty for the people, but most of the people do not show gratitude.\n\n**244** (244) And fight in the cause of All?h and know that All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**245** (245) Who is it that would loan All?h a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And it is All?h who withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**246** (246) Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after [the time of] Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs, \"Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of All?h\"? He said, \"Would you perhaps refrain from fighting if battle was prescribed for you?\" They said, \"And why should we not fight in the cause of All?h when we have been driven out from our homes and from our children?\" But when battle was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. And All?h is Knowing of the wrongdoers.\n\n**247** (247) And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, All?h has sent to you Saul as a king.\" They said, \"How can he have kingship over us while we are more worthy of kingship than him and he has not been given any measure of wealth?\" He said, \"Indeed, All?h has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And All?h gives His sovereignty to whom He wills. And All?h is all-Encompassing [in favor] and Knowing.\"\n\n**248** (248) And their prophet said to them, \"Indeed, a sign of his kingship is that the chest will come to you in which is assurance[97] from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron had left, carried by the angels. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.\"\n\n**249** (249) And when Saul went forth with the soldiers, he said, \"Indeed, All?h will be testing you with a river. So whoever drinks from it is not of me, and whoever does not taste it is indeed of me, excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand.\" But they drank from it, except a [very] few of them. Then when he had crossed it along with those who believed with him, they said, \"There is no power for us today against Goliath and his soldiers.\" But those who were certain that they would meet All?h said, \"How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of All?h. And All?h is with the patient.\"\n\n**25** (25) And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a provision of fruit therefrom, they will say, \"This is what we were provided with before.\" And it is given to them in likeness. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**250** (250) And when they went forth to [face] Goliath and his soldiers, they said, \"Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.\"\n\n**251** (251) So they defeated them by permission of All?h, and David killed Goliath, and All?h gave him the kingship and wisdom [i.e., prophethood] and taught him from that which He willed. And if it were not for All?h checking [some] people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but All?h is the possessor of bounty for the worlds.\n\n**252** (252) These are the verses of All?h which We recite to you, [O Mu?ammad], in truth. And indeed, you are from among the messengers.\n\n**253** (253) Those messengers - some of them We caused to exceed others. Among them were those to whom All?h spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs, and We supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., Gabriel]. If All?h had willed, those [generations] succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, and some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if All?h had willed, they would not have fought each other, but All?h does what He intends.\n\n**254** (254) O you who have believed, spend from that which We have provided for you before there comes a Day in which there is no exchange [i.e., ransom] and no friendship and no intercession. And the disbelievers - they are the wrongdoers.\n\n**255** (255) All?h - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living,[98] the Self-Sustaining.[99] Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[100] and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kurs?[101] extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High,[102] the Most Great.[103]\n\n**256** (256) There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become distinct from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in ??gh?t[104] and believes in All?h has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**257** (257) All?h is the Ally[105] of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light. And those who disbelieve - their allies are ??gh?t. They take them out of the light into darknesses.[106] Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.\n\n**258** (258) Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord [merely] because All?h had given him kingship? When Abraham said, \"My Lord is the one who gives life and causes death,\" he said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said, \"Indeed, All?h brings up the sun from the east, so bring it up from the west.\" So the disbeliever was overwhelmed [by astonishment], and All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n\n**259** (259) Or [consider such an example] as the one who passed by a township which had fallen into ruin. He said, \"How will All?h bring this to life after its death?\" So All?h caused him to die for a hundred years; then He revived him. He said, \"How long have you remained?\" He [the man] said, \"I have remained a day or part of a day.\" He said, \"Rather, you have remained one hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; it has not changed with time. And look at your donkey; and We will make you a sign for the people. And look at the bones [of this donkey] - how We raise them and then We cover them with flesh.\" And when it became clear to him, he said, \"I know that All?h is over all things competent.\"\n\n**26** (26) Indeed, All?h is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller[15] than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, \"What did All?h intend by this as an example?\" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,\n\n**260** (260) And [mention] when Abraham said, \"My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.\" [All?h] said, \"Have you not believed?\" He said, \"Yes, but [I ask] only that my heart may be satisfied.\" [All?h] said, \"Take four birds and commit them to yourself.[107] Then [after slaughtering them] put on each hill a portion of them; then call them - they will come [flying] to you in haste. And know that All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"\n\n**261** (261) The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of All?h is like a seed [of grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And All?h multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And All?h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\n\n**262** (262) Those who spend their wealth in the way of All?h and then do not follow up what they have spent with reminders [of it] or [other] injury will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**263** (263) Kind speech and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And All?h is Free of need and Forbearing.\n\n**264** (264) O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders [of it] or injury as does one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by the people and does not believe in All?h and the Last Day. His example is like that of a [large] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare. They are unable [to keep] anything of what they have earned. And All?h does not guide the disbelieving people.\n\n**265** (265) And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking means to the approval of All?h and assuring [reward for] themselves is like a garden on high ground which is hit by a downpour - so it yields its fruits in double. And [even] if it is not hit by a downpour, then a drizzle [is sufficient]. And All?h, of what you do, is Seeing.\n\n**266** (266) Would one of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines underneath which rivers flow in which he has from every fruit? But he is afflicted with old age and has weak [i.e., immature] offspring, and it is hit by a whirlwind containing fire and is burned. Thus does All?h make clear to you [His] verses that you might give thought.\n\n**267** (267) O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth. And do not aim toward the defective therefrom, spending [from that] while you would not take it [yourself] except with closed eyes. And know that All?h is Free of need and Praiseworthy.\n\n**268** (268) Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while All?h promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And All?h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\n\n**269** (269) He gives wisdom[108] to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.\n\n**27** (27) Who break the covenant of All?h after contracting it and sever that which All?h has ordered to be joined and cause corruption on earth. It is those who are the losers.\n\n**270** (270) And whatever you spend of expenditures or make of vows - indeed, All?h knows of it. And for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.\n\n**271** (271) If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you, and He will remove from you some of your misdeeds [thereby]. And All?h, of what you do, is [fully] Aware.\n\n**272** (272) Not upon you, [O Mu?ammad], is [responsibility for] their guidance, but All?h guides whom He wills. And whatever good you [believers] spend is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seeking the face [i.e., approval] of All?h. And whatever you spend of good[109] - it will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.\n\n**273** (273) [Charity is] for the poor who have been restricted for the cause of All?h, unable to move about in the land. An ignorant [person] would think them self-sufficient because of their restraint, but you will know them by their [characteristic] sign. They do not ask people persistently [or at all]. And whatever you spend of good - indeed, All?h is Knowing of it.\n\n**274** (274) Those who spend their wealth [in All?h's way] by night and by day, secretly and publicly - they will have their reward with their Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**275** (275) Those who consume interest[110] cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, \"Trade is [just] like interest.\" But All?h has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with All?h. But whoever returns [to dealing in interest or usury] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide eternally therein.\n\n**276** (276) All?h destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And All?h does not like every sinning disbeliever.\n\n**277** (277) Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds and establish prayer and give zak?h will have their reward with their Lord, and there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**278** (278) O you who have believed, fear All?h and give up what remains [due to you] of interest, if you should be believers.\n\n**279** (279) And if you do not, then be informed of a war [against you] from All?h and His Messenger. But if you repent, you may have your principal - [thus] you do no wrong, nor are you wronged.\n\n**28** (28) How can you disbelieve in All?h when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned.\n\n**280** (280) And if someone is in hardship, then [let there be] postponement until [a time of] ease. But if you give [from your right as] charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.\n\n**281** (281) And fear a Day when you will be returned to All?h. Then every soul will be compensated for what it earned, and they will not be wronged [i.e., treated unjustly].\n\n**282** (282) O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as All?h has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation [i.e., the debtor] dictate. And let him fear All?h, his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of them [i.e., the women] errs, then the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be [too] weary to write it, whether it is small or large, for its [specified] term. That is more just in the sight of All?h and stronger as evidence and more likely to prevent doubt between you, except when it is an immediate transaction which you conduct among yourselves. For [then] there is no blame upon you if you do not write it. And take witnesses when you conclude a contract. Let no scribe be harmed or any witness. For if you do so, indeed, it is [grave] disobedience in you. And fear All?h. And All?h teaches you. And All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**283** (283) And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a security deposit [should be] taken. And if one of you entrusts another, then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust [faithfully] and let him fear All?h, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony, for whoever conceals it - his heart is indeed sinful, and All?h is Knowing of what you do.\n\n**284** (284) To All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, All?h will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**285** (285) The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in All?h and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], \"We make no distinction between any of His messengers.\" And they say, \"We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.\"\n\n**286** (286) All?h does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. \"Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.\"[111]\n\n**29** (29) It is He who created for you all of that which is on the earth. Then He directed Himself[16] to the heaven, [His being above all creation], and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things.\n\n**3** (3) Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer,[9] and spend out of what We[10] have provided for them,\n\n**30** (30) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.\"[17] They said, \"Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we exalt You with praise and declare Your perfection?\"[18] He [All?h] said, \"Indeed, I know that which you do not know.\"\n\n**31** (31) And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\"\n\n**32** (32) They said, \"Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing,[19] the Wise.\"[20]\n\n**33** (33) He said, \"O Adam, inform them of their names.\" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you reveal and what you have concealed.\"\n\n**34** (34) And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate before Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees.[21] He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\n\n**35** (35) And We said, \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**36** (36) But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, \"Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time.\"\n\n**37** (37) Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words,[22] and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of Repentance,[23] the Merciful.\n\n**38** (38) We said, \"Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**39** (39) And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\"\n\n**4** (4) And who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].\n\n**40** (40) O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant [upon you] that I will fulfill your covenant [from Me], and be afraid of [only] Me.\n\n**41** (41) And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.\n\n**42** (42) And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it].\n\n**43** (43) And establish prayer and give zak?h[24] and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience].\n\n**44** (44) Do you order righteousness of the people and forget[25] yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?\n\n**45** (45) And seek help through patience and prayer; and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to All?h]\n\n**46** (46) Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.\n\n**47** (47) O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds [i.e., peoples].\n\n**48** (48) And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul[26] at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.\n\n**49** (49) And [recall] when We saved you [i.e., your forefathers] from the people of Pharaoh, who afflicted you with the worst torment, slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.\n\n**5** (5) Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.\n\n**50** (50) And [recall] when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on.\n\n**51** (51) And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him [i.e., his departure], while you were wrongdoers.\n\n**52** (52) Then We forgave you after that so perhaps you would be grateful.\n\n**53** (53) And [recall] when We gave Moses the Scripture and criterion[27] that perhaps you would be guided.\n\n**54** (54) And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [for worship]. So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves [i.e., the guilty among you]. That is best for [all of] you in the sight of your Creator.\" Then He accepted your repentance; indeed, He is the Accepting of Repentance, the Merciful.\n\n**55** (55) And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we will never believe you until we see All?h outright\"; so the thunderbolt took you while you were looking on.\n\n**56** (56) Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful.\n\n**57** (57) And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not - but they were [only] wronging themselves.\n\n**58** (58) And [recall] when We said, \"Enter this city [i.e., Jerusalem] and eat from it wherever you will in [ease and] abundance, and enter the gate bowing humbly[28] and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens [i.e., sins].' We will [then] forgive your sins for you, and We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"\n\n**59** (59) But those who wronged changed [those words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them, so We sent down upon those who wronged a punishment [i.e., plague] from the sky because they were defiantly disobeying.\n\n**6** (6) Indeed, those who disbelieve[11] - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe.\n\n**60** (60) And [recall] when Moses prayed for water for his people, so We said, \"Strike with your staff the stone.\" And there gushed forth from it twelve springs, and every people [i.e., tribe] knew its watering place. \"Eat and drink from the provision of All?h, and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"\n\n**61** (61) And [recall] when you said, \"O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions.\" [Moses] said, \"Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked.\" And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from All?h [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of All?h and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.\n\n**62** (62) Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans [before Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] - those [among them] who believed in All?h and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve[29].\n\n**63** (63) And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.\"\n\n**64** (64) Then you turned away after that. And if not for the favor of All?h upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers.\n\n**65** (65) And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"\n\n**66** (66) And We made it a deterrent punishment for those who were present and those who succeeded [them] and a lesson for those who fear All?h.\n\n**67** (67) And [recall] when Moses said to his people, \"Indeed, All?h commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Do you take us in ridicule?\" He said, \"I seek refuge in All?h from being among the ignorant.\"\n\n**68** (68) They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is.\" [Moses] said, \"[All?h] says, 'It is a cow which is neither old nor virgin, but median between that,' so do what you are commanded.\"\n\n**69** (69) They said, \"Call upon your Lord to show us what is her color.\" He said, \"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in color - pleasing to the observers.'\"\n\n**7** (7) All?h has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil.[12] And for them is a great punishment.\n\n**70** (70) They said, \"Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, [all] cows look alike to us. And indeed we, if All?h wills, will be guided.\"\n\n**71** (71) He said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor to irrigate the field, one free from fault with no spot upon her.'\" They said, \"Now you have come with the truth.\" So they slaughtered her, but they could hardly do it.\n\n**72** (72) And [recall] when you slew a man and disputed[30] over it, but All?h was to bring out that which you were concealing.\n\n**73** (73) So We said, \"Strike him [i.e., the slain man] with part of it.\"[31] Thus does All?h bring the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you might reason.\n\n**74** (74) Then your hearts became hardened after that, being like stones or even harder. For indeed, there are stones from which rivers burst forth, and there are some of them that split open and water comes out, and there are some of them that fall down for fear of All?h. And All?h is not unaware of what you do.\n\n**75** (75) Do you covet [the hope, O believers], that they would believe for you while a party of them used to hear the words of All?h and then distort it [i.e., the Torah] after they had understood it while they were knowing?\n\n**76** (76) And when they meet those who believe, they say, \"We have believed\"; but when they are alone with one another, they say, \"Do you talk to them about what All?h has revealed to you so they can argue with you about it before your Lord?\" Then will you not reason?\n\n**77** (77) But do they not know that All?h knows what they conceal and what they declare?\n\n**78** (78) And among them are unlettered ones who do not know the Scripture except [indulgement in] wishful thinking, but they are only assuming.\n\n**79** (79) So woe[32] to those who write the \"scripture\" with their own hands, then say, \"This is from All?h,\" in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.\n\n**8** (8) And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in All?h and the Last Day,\" but they are not believers.\n\n**80** (80) And they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us, except for [a few] numbered days.\" Say, \"Have you taken a covenant with All?h? For All?h will never break His covenant. Or do you say about All?h that which you do not know?\"\n\n**81** (81) Yes, [on the contrary], whoever earns evil and his sin has encompassed him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**82** (82) But they who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**83** (83) And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], \"Do not worship except All?h; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zak?h.\" Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing.\n\n**84** (84) And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], \"Do not shed your [i.e., each other's] blood or evict one another from your homes.\" Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.\n\n**85** (85) Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their eviction was forbidden to you. So do you believe in part of the Scripture and disbelieve in part? Then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life; and on the Day of Resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment. And All?h is not unaware of what you do.\n\n**86** (86) Those are the ones who have bought the life of this world [in exchange] for the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided.\n\n**87** (87) And We did certainly give Moses the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel]. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed.\n\n**88** (88) And they said, \"Our hearts are wrapped.\"[33] But, [in fact], All?h has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is it that they believe.\n\n**89** (89) And when there came to them a Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] from All?h confirming that which was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but [then] when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it; so the curse of All?h will be upon the disbelievers.\n\n**9** (9) They [think to] deceive All?h and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not.\n\n**90** (90) How wretched is that for which they sold themselves - that they would disbelieve in what All?h has revealed through [their] outrage that All?h would send down His favor upon whom He wills from among His servants. So they returned having [earned] wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.\n\n**91** (91) And when it is said to them, \"Believe in what All?h has revealed,\" they say, \"We believe [only] in what was revealed to us.\" And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them. Say, \"Then why did you kill the prophets of All?h before, if you are [indeed] believers?\"\n\n**92** (92) And Moses had certainly brought you clear proofs. Then you took the calf [in worship] after that, while you were wrongdoers.\n\n**93** (93) And [recall] when We took your covenant and raised over you the mount, [saying], \"Take what We have given you with determination and listen.\" They said [instead], \"We hear and disobey.\" And their hearts absorbed [the worship of] the calf because of their disbelief. Say, \"How wretched is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you should be believers.\"\n\n**94** (94) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"If the home of the Hereafter with All?h is for you alone and not the [other] people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**95** (95) But never will they wish for it, ever, because of what their hands have put forth. And All?h is Knowing of the wrongdoers.\n\n**96** (96) And you will surely find them the most greedy of people for life - [even] more than those who associate others with All?h. One of them wishes that he could be granted life a thousand years, but it would not remove him in the least from the [coming] punishment that he should be granted life. And All?h is Seeing of what they do.\n\n**97** (97) Say, \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - it is [none but] he who has brought it [i.e., the Qur�?n] down upon your heart, [O Mu?ammad], by permission of All?h, confirming that which was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers.\"\n\n**98** (98) Whoever is an enemy to All?h and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, All?h is an enemy to the disbelievers.\n\n**99** (99) And We have certainly revealed to you verses [which are] clear proofs, and no one would deny them except the defiantly disobedient."

And it is they who are fuel for the Fire.\n\n**100** (100) O you who have believed, if you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture, they would turn you back, after your belief, [to being] unbelievers.\n\n**101** (101) And how could you disbelieve while to you are being recited the verses of All?h and among you is His Messenger? And whoever holds firmly to All?h[141] has [indeed] been guided to a straight path.\n\n**102** (102) O you who have believed, fear All?h as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him].\n\n**103** (103) And hold firmly to the rope[142] of All?h all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of All?h upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does All?h make clear to you His verses that you may be guided.\n\n**104** (104) And let there be [arising] from you a nation inviting to [all that is] good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong,[143] and those will be the successful.\n\n**105** (105) And do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment\n\n**106** (106) On the Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces will turn black. As for those whose faces turn black, [to them it will be said], \"Did you disbelieve [i.e., reject faith] after your belief? Then taste the punishment for what you used to reject.\"\n\n**107** (107) But as for those whose faces turn white, [they will be] within the mercy of All?h. They will abide therein eternally.\n\n**108** (108) These are the verses of All?h. We recite them to you, [O Mu?ammad], in truth; and All?h wants no injustice to the worlds [i.e., His creatures].\n\n**109** (109) To All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And to All?h will [all] matters be returned.\n\n**11** (11) [Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They denied Our signs, so All?h seized them for their sins. And All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**110** (110) You are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in All?h. If only the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**111** (111) They will not harm you except for [some] annoyance. And if they fight you, they will show you their backs [i.e., retreat]; then they will not be aided.\n\n**112** (112) They have been put under humiliation [by All?h] wherever they are overtaken, except for a rope [i.e., covenant] from All?h and a rope [i.e., treaty] from the people [i.e., the Muslims].[144] And they have drawn upon themselves anger from All?h and have been put under destitution. That is because they disbelieved in [i.e., rejected] the verses of All?h and killed the prophets without right. That is because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.\n\n**113** (113) They are not [all] the same; among the People of the Scripture is a community[145] standing [in obedience], reciting the verses of All?h during periods of the night and prostrating [in prayer].\n\n**114** (114) They believe in All?h and the Last Day, and they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and hasten to good deeds. And those are among the righteous.\n\n**115** (115) And whatever good they do - never will it be denied them. And All?h is Knowing of the righteous.\n\n**116** (116) Indeed, those who disbelieve - never will their wealth or their children avail them against All?h at all, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**117** (117) The example of what they spend in this worldly life is like that of a wind containing frost which strikes the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves [i.e., sinned] and destroys it. And All?h has not wronged them, but they wrong themselves.\n\n**118** (118) O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other than yourselves [i.e., believers], for they will not spare you [any] ruin. They wish you would have hardship. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have certainly made clear to you the signs, if you will use reason.\n\n**119** (119) Here you are loving them but they are not loving you, while you believe in the Scripture - all of it.[146] And when they meet you, they say, \"We believe.\" But when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you in rage. Say, \"Die in your rage. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of that within the breasts.\"\n\n**12** (12) Say to those who disbelieve, \"You will be overcome and gathered together to Hell, and wretched is the resting place.\"\n\n**120** (120) If good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you, they rejoice at it. And if you are patient and fear All?h, their plot will not harm you at all. Indeed, All?h is encompassing of what they do.\n\n**121** (121) And [remember] when you, [O Mu?ammad], left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle [of U?ud] - and All?h is Hearing and Knowing -\n\n**122** (122) When two parties among you were about to lose courage, but All?h was their ally; and upon All?h the believers should rely.\n\n**123** (123) And already had All?h given you victory at [the battle of] Badr while you were weak [i.e., few in number]. Then fear All?h; perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**124** (124) [Remember] when you said to the believers, \"Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?\n\n**125** (125) Yes, if you remain patient and conscious of All?h and they [i.e., the enemy] come upon you [attacking] in rage, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels having marks [of distinction].\"\n\n**126** (126) And All?h made it not except as [a sign of] good tidings for you and to reassure your hearts thereby. And victory is not except from All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise -\n\n**127** (127) That He might cut down a section of the disbelievers or suppress them so that they turn back disappointed.\n\n**128** (128) Not for you, [O Mu?ammad, but for All?h], is the decision whether He should [cut them down] or forgive them or punish them, for indeed, they are wrongdoers.\n\n**129** (129) And to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**13** (13) Already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met [in combat at Badr] - one fighting in the cause of All?h and another of disbelievers. They saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [their] eyesight.[118] But All?h supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision.\n\n**130** (130) O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear All?h that you may be successful.\n\n**131** (131) And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers.\n\n**132** (132) And obey All?h and the Messenger that you may obtain mercy.\n\n**133** (133) And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden [i.e., Paradise] as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous\n\n**134** (134) Who spend [in the cause of All?h] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and who pardon the people - and All?h loves the doers of good;\n\n**135** (135) And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong themselves [by transgression], remember All?h and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except All?h? - and [who] do not persist in what they have done while they know.\n\n**136** (136) Those - their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow [in Paradise], wherein they will abide eternally; and excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers.\n\n**137** (137) Similar situations [as yours] have passed on before you, so proceed throughout the earth and observe how was the end of those who denied.\n\n**138** (138) This [Qur�?n] is a clear statement to [all] the people and a guidance and instruction for those conscious of All?h.\n\n**139** (139) So do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers.\n\n**14** (14) Beautified for people is the love of that which they desire - of women and sons, heaped-up sums of gold and silver, fine branded horses, and cattle and tilled land. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, but All?h has with Him the best return [i.e., Paradise].\n\n**140** (140) If a wound should touch you - there has already touched the [opposing] people a wound similar to it. And these days [of varying conditions] We alternate among the people so that All?h may make evident those who believe and [may] take to Himself from among you martyrs - and All?h does not like the wrongdoers -\n\n**141** (141) And that All?h may purify the believers [through trials] and destroy the disbelievers.\n\n**142** (142) Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while All?h has not yet made evident those of you who fight in His cause and made evident those who are steadfast?\n\n**143** (143) And you had certainly wished for death [i.e., martyrdom] before you encountered it, and you have [now] seen it [before you] while you were looking on.\n\n**144** (144) Mu?ammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he was to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]? And he who turns back on his heels will never harm All?h at all; but All?h will reward the grateful.\n\n**145** (145) And it is not [possible] for one to die except by permission of All?h at a decree determined. And whoever desires the reward of this world - We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter - We will give him thereof. And We will reward the grateful.\n\n**146** (146) And how many a prophet [fought in battle and] with him fought many religious scholars. But they never lost assurance due to what afflicted them in the cause of All?h, nor did they weaken or submit. And All?h loves the steadfast.\n\n**147** (147) And their words were not but that they said, \"Our Lord, forgive us our sins and the excess [committed] in our affairs and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people.\"\n\n**148** (148) So All?h gave them the reward of this world and the good reward of the Hereafter. And All?h loves the doers of good.\n\n**149** (149) O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will [then] become losers.\n\n**15** (15) Say, \"Shall I inform you of [something] better than that? For those who fear All?h will be gardens in the presence of their Lord beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and purified spouses and approval from All?h. And All?h is Seeing [i.e., aware] of [His] servants -\n\n**150** (150) But All?h is your protector, and He is the best of helpers.\n\n**151** (151) We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve for what they have associated with All?h of which He had not sent down [any] authority.[147] And their refuge will be the Fire, and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers.\n\n**152** (152) And All?h had certainly fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing them [i.e., the enemy] by His permission until [the time] when you lost courage and fell to disputing about the order [given by the Prophet (?)] and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you love.[148] Among you are some who desire this world, and among you are some who desire the Hereafter. Then He turned you back from them [defeated] that He might test you. And He has already forgiven you, and All?h is the possessor of bounty for the believers.\n\n**153** (153) [Remember] when you [fled and] climbed [the mountain] without looking aside at anyone while the Messenger was calling you from behind. So All?h repaid you with distress upon distress so you would not grieve for that which had escaped you [of victory and spoils of war] or [for] that which had befallen you [of injury and death]. And All?h is [fully] Aware of what you do.\n\n**154** (154) Then after distress, He sent down upon you security [in the form of] drowsiness, overcoming a faction of you, while another faction worried about themselves, thinking of All?h other than the truth - the thought of ignorance, saying, \"Is there anything for us [to have done] in this matter?\" Say, \"Indeed, the matter belongs completely to All?h.\" They conceal within themselves what they will not reveal to you. They say, \"If there was anything we could have done in the matter, we [i.e., some of us] would not have been killed right here.\" Say, \"Even if you had been inside your houses, those decreed to be killed would have come out to their death beds.\" [It was] so that All?h might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts. And All?h is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**155** (155) Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met [at U?ud] - it was Satan who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned. But All?h has already forgiven them. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Forbearing.\n\n**156** (156) O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled through the land or went out to fight, \"If they had been with us, they would not have died or have been killed,\" so All?h makes that [misconception] a regret within their hearts. And it is All?h who gives life and causes death, and All?h is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**157** (157) And if you are killed in the cause of All?h or die - then forgiveness from All?h and mercy are better than whatever they accumulate [in this world].\n\n**158** (158) And whether you die or are killed, unto All?h you will be gathered.\n\n**159** (159) So by mercy from All?h, [O Mu?ammad], you were lenient with them. And if you had been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon All?h. Indeed, All?h loves those who rely [upon Him].\n\n**16** (16) Those who say, 'Our Lord, indeed we have believed, so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire,' \"\n\n**160** (160) If All?h should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon All?h let the believers rely.\n\n**161** (161) It is not [attributable] to any prophet that he would act unfaithfully [in regard to war booty]. And whoever betrays, [taking unlawfully], will come with what he took on the Day of Resurrection. Then will every soul be [fully] compensated for what it earned, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**162** (162) So is one who pursues the pleasure of All?h like one who brings upon himself the anger of All?h and whose refuge is Hell? And wretched is the destination.\n\n**163** (163) They are [varying] degrees in the sight of All?h, and All?h is Seeing of whatever they do.\n\n**164** (164) Certainly did All?h confer [great] favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from themselves, reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] and wisdom,[149] although they had been before in manifest error.\n\n**165** (165) Why [is it that] when a [single] disaster struck you [on the day of U?ud], although you had struck [the enemy in the battle of Badr] with one twice as great, you said, \"From where is this?\" Say, \"It is from yourselves [i.e., due to your sin].\" Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**166** (166) And what struck you on the day the two armies met [at U?ud] was by permission of All?h that He might make evident the [true] believers\n\n**167** (167) And that He might make evident those who are hypocrites. For it was said to them, \"Come, fight in the way of All?h or [at least] defend.\" They said, \"If we had known [there would be] battle, we would have followed you.\" They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And All?h is most knowing of what they conceal -\n\n**168** (168) Those who said about their brothers while sitting [at home], \"If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Then prevent death from yourselves, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**169** (169) And never think of those who have been killed in the cause of All?h as dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision,\n\n**17** (17) The patient, the true, the obedient, those who spend [in the way of All?h], and those who seek forgiveness before dawn.\n\n**170** (170) Rejoicing in what All?h has bestowed upon them of His bounty, and they receive good tidings about those [to be martyred] after them who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**171** (171) They receive good tidings of favor from All?h and bounty and [of the fact] that All?h does not allow the reward of believers to be lost -\n\n**172** (172) Those [believers] who responded to All?h and the Messenger after injury had struck them. For those who did good among them and feared All?h is a great reward -\n\n**173** (173) Those to whom people [i.e., hypocrites] said, \"Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them.\" But it [merely] increased them in faith, and they said, \"Sufficient for us is All?h, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs.\"[150]\n\n**174** (174) So they returned with favor from All?h and bounty, no harm having touched them. And they pursued the pleasure of All?h, and All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**175** (175) That is only Satan who frightens [you] of his supporters. So fear them not, but fear Me, if you are [indeed] believers.\n\n**176** (176) And do not be grieved, [O Mu?ammad], by those who hasten into disbelief. Indeed, they will never harm All?h at all. All?h intends that He should give them no share in the Hereafter, and for them is a great punishment.\n\n**177** (177) Indeed, those who purchase disbelief [in exchange] for faith - never will they harm All?h at all, and for them is a painful punishment.\n\n**178** (178) And let not those who disbelieve ever think that [because] We extend their time [of enjoyment] it is better for them. We only extend it for them so that they may increase in sin, and for them is a humiliating punishment.\n\n**179** (179) All?h would not leave the believers in that [state] you are in [presently] until He separates the evil from the good. Nor would All?h reveal to you the unseen. But [instead], All?h chooses of His messengers whom He wills, so believe in All?h and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Him, then for you is a great reward.\n\n**18** (18) All?h witnesses that there is no deity except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - [that He is] maintaining [creation] in justice. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**180** (180) And let not those who [greedily] withhold what All?h has given them of His bounty ever think that it is better for them. Rather, it is worse for them. Their necks will be encircled by what they withheld on the Day of Resurrection. And to All?h belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. And All?h, of what you do, is [fully] Aware.\n\n**181** (181) All?h has certainly heard the statement of those [Jews] who said, \"Indeed, All?h is poor, while we are rich.\" We will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right and will say, \"Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.\n\n**182** (182) That is for what your hands have put forth and because All?h is not ever unjust to [His] servants.\"\n\n**183** (183) [They are] those who said, \"Indeed, All?h has taken our promise not to believe any messenger until he brings us an offering which fire [from heaven] will consume.\" Say, \"There have already come to you messengers before me with clear proofs and [even] that of which you speak. So why did you kill them, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**184** (184) Then if they deny you, [O Mu?ammad] - so were messengers denied before you, who brought clear proofs and written ordinances and the enlightening Scripture.[151]\n\n**185** (185) Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion.\n\n**186** (186) You will surely be tested in your possessions and in yourselves. And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with All?h much abuse. But if you are patient and fear All?h - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of resolve.\n\n**187** (187) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when All?h took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying], \"You must make it clear [i.e., explain it] to the people and not conceal it.\" But they threw it away behind their backs and exchanged it for a small price. And wretched is that which they purchased.\n\n**188** (188) And never think that those who rejoice in what they have perpetrated and like to be praised for what they did not do - never think them [to be] in safety from the punishment, and for them is a painful punishment.\n\n**189** (189) And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**19** (19) Indeed, the religion in the sight of All?h is Isl?m. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of All?h, then indeed, All?h is swift in [taking] account.\n\n**190** (190) Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding -\n\n**191** (191) Who remember All?h while standing or sitting or [lying] on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, [saying], \"Our Lord, You did not create this aimlessly; exalted are You [above such a thing]; then protect us from the punishment of the Fire.\n\n**192** (192) Our Lord, indeed whoever You admit to the Fire - You have disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.\n\n**193** (193) Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] calling to faith, [saying], 'Believe in your Lord,' and we have believed. Our Lord, so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and cause us to die among the righteous.\n\n**194** (194) Our Lord, and grant us what You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in [Your] promise.\"\n\n**195** (195) And their Lord responded to them, \"Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another. So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from All?h, and All?h has with Him the best reward.\"\n\n**196** (196) Be not deceived by the [uninhibited] movement of the disbelievers throughout the land.\n\n**197** (197) [It is but] a small enjoyment; then their [final] refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.\n\n**198** (198) But those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein, as accommodation from All?h. And that which is with All?h is best for the righteous.\n\n**199** (199) And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in All?h and what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, [being] humbly submissive to All?h. They do not exchange the verses of All?h for a small price. Those will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, All?h is swift in account.\n\n**2** (2) All?h - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.[114]\n\n**20** (20) So if they argue with you, say, \"I have submitted myself to All?h [in Isl?m], and [so have] those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture and [to] the unlearned,[119] \"Have you submitted yourselves?\" And if they submit [in Isl?m], they are rightly guided; but if they turn away - then upon you is only the [duty of] notification. And All?h is Seeing of [His] servants.\n\n**200** (200) O you who have believed, persevere[152] and endure[153] and remain stationed[154] and fear All?h that you may be successful.\n\n**21** (21) Those who disbelieve in the signs of All?h and kill the prophets without right and kill those who order justice from among the people - give them tidings of a painful punishment.\n\n**22** (22) They are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there will be no helpers.\n\n**23** (23) Do you not consider, [O Mu?ammad], those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They are invited to the Scripture of All?h that it should arbitrate between them;[120] then a party of them turns away, and they are refusing.\n\n**24** (24) That is because they say, \"Never will the Fire touch us except for [a few] numbered days,\" and [because] they were deluded in their religion by what they were inventing.\n\n**25** (25) So how will it be when We assemble them for a Day about which there is no doubt? And each soul will be compensated [in full for] what it earned, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**26** (26) Say, \"O All?h, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand[121] is [all] good. Indeed, You are over all things competent.\n\n**27** (27) You cause the night to enter the day, and You cause the day to enter the night; and You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give provision to whom You will without account [i.e., limit or measure].\"\n\n**28** (28) Let not believers take disbelievers as allies [i.e., supporters or protectors] rather than believers. And whoever [of you] does that has nothing [i.e., no association] with All?h, except when taking precaution against them in prudence.[122] And All?h warns you of Himself, and to All?h is the [final] destination.\n\n**29** (29) Say, \"Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or reveal it, All?h knows it. And He knows that which is in the heavens and that which is on the earth. And All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**3** (3) He has sent down upon you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel\n\n**30** (30) The Day every soul will find what it has done of good present [before it] and what it has done of evil, it will wish that between itself and that [evil] was a great distance. And All?h warns you of Himself, and All?h is Kind to [His] servants.\"\n\n**31** (31) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"If you should love All?h, then follow me, [so] All?h will love you and forgive you your sins. And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**32** (32) Say, \"Obey All?h and the Messenger. But if you turn away - then indeed, All?h does not like the disbelievers.\"\n\n**33** (33) Indeed, All?h chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of ?Imr?n over the worlds -\n\n**34** (34) Descendants, some of them from others. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**35** (35) [Mention, O Mu?ammad], when the wife of ?Imr?n said, \"My Lord, indeed I have pledged to You what is in my womb, consecrated [for Your service], so accept this from me. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.\"\n\n**36** (36) But when she delivered her, she said, \"My Lord, I have delivered a female.\" And All?h was most knowing of what she delivered, and the male is not like the female. \"And I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her in You and [for] her descendants from Satan, the expelled [from the mercy of All?h].\"\n\n**37** (37) So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her in the care of Zechariah. Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, \"O Mary, from where is this [coming] to you?\" She said, \"It is from All?h. Indeed, All?h provides for whom He wills without account.\"\n\n**38** (38) At that, Zechariah called upon his Lord, saying, \"My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication.\"\n\n**39** (39) So the angels called him while he was standing in prayer in the chamber, \"Indeed, All?h gives you good tidings of John, confirming a word[123] from All?h and [who will be] honorable, abstaining [from women], and a prophet from among the righteous.\"\n\n**4** (4) Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Criterion [i.e., the Qur�?n]. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of All?h will have a severe punishment, and All?h is Exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution.[115]\n\n**40** (40) He said, \"My Lord, how will I have a boy when I have reached old age and my wife is barren?\" He [the angel] said, \"Such is All?h; He does what He wills.\"\n\n**41** (41) He said, \"My Lord, make for me a sign.\" He said, \"Your sign is that you will not [be able to] speak to the people for three days except by gesture. And remember your Lord much and exalt [Him with praise] in the evening and the morning.\"\n\n**42** (42) And [mention] when the angels said, \"O Mary, indeed All?h has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds.\n\n**43** (43) O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow [in prayer].\"\n\n**44** (44) That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Mu?ammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens[124] as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed.\n\n**45** (45) [And mention] when the angels said, \"O Mary, indeed All?h gives you good tidings of a word[125] from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to All?h].\n\n**46** (46) He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous.\"\n\n**47** (47) She said, \"My Lord, how will I have a child when no man has touched me?\" [The angel] said, \"Such is All?h; He creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is.\n\n**48** (48) And He will teach him writing and wisdom[126] and the Torah and the Gospel\n\n**49** (49) And [make him] a messenger to the Children of Israel, [who will say], 'Indeed I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay [that which is] like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by permission of All?h. And I cure the blind [from birth] and the leper, and I give life to the dead - by permission of All?h. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers.\n\n**5** (5) Indeed, from All?h nothing is hidden in the earth nor in the heaven.\n\n**50** (50) And [I have come] confirming what was before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear All?h and obey me.\n\n**51** (51) Indeed, All?h is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is the straight path.'\"\n\n**52** (52) But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, \"Who are my supporters for [the cause of] All?h?\" The disciples said, \"We are supporters for All?h. We have believed in All?h and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].\n\n**53** (53) Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have followed the messenger [i.e., Jesus], so register us among the witnesses [to truth].\"\n\n**54** (54) And they [i.e., the disbelievers] planned, but All?h planned. And All?h is the best of planners.\n\n**55** (55) [Mention] when All?h said, \"O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify [i.e., free] you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission to All?h alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.\n\n**56** (56) And as for those who disbelieved, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.\"\n\n**57** (57) But as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will give them in full their rewards, and All?h does not like the wrongdoers.\n\n**58** (58) This is what We recite to you, [O Mu?ammad], of [Our] verses and the precise [and wise] message [i.e., the Qur�?n].\n\n**59** (59) Indeed, the example of Jesus to All?h[127] is like that of Adam. He created him from dust; then He said to him, \"Be,\" and he was.\n\n**6** (6) It is He who forms you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**60** (60) The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters.\n\n**61** (61) Then whoever argues with you about it after [this] knowledge has come to you - say, \"Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then supplicate earnestly [together] and invoke the curse of All?h upon the liars [among us].\"\n\n**62** (62) Indeed, this is the true narration. And there is no deity except All?h. And indeed, All?h is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**63** (63) But if they turn away, then indeed - All?h is Knowing of the corrupters.\n\n**64** (64) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except All?h and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of All?h.\"[128] But if they turn away, then say, \"Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].\"\n\n**65** (65) O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason?\n\n**66** (66) Here you are - those who have argued about that of which you have [some] knowledge, but why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge? And All?h knows, while you know not.\n\n**67** (67) Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to All?h]. And he was not of the polytheists.[129]\n\n**68** (68) Indeed, the most worthy of Abraham among the people are those who followed him [in submission to All?h] and this prophet [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] and those who believe [in his message]. And All?h is the Ally[130] of the believers.\n\n**69** (69) A faction of the People of the Scripture wish they could mislead you. But they do not mislead except themselves, and they perceive [it] not.\n\n**7** (7) It is He who has sent down to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book; in it are verses [that are] precise - they are the foundation of the Book - and others unspecific.[116] As for those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one knows its [true] interpretation except All?h. But those firm in knowledge say, \"We believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord.\" And no one will be reminded except those of understanding,\n\n**70** (70) O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of All?h[131] while you witness [to their truth]?\n\n**71** (71) O People of the Scripture, why do you mix [i.e., confuse] the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know [it]?\n\n**72** (72) And a faction of the People of the Scripture say [to each other], \"Believe in that which was revealed to the believers at the beginning of the day and reject it at its end that perhaps they will return [i.e., abandon their religion],\n\n**73** (73) And do not trust except those who follow your religion.\" Say, \"Indeed, the [true] guidance is the guidance of All?h. [Do you fear] lest someone be given [knowledge] like you were given or that they would [thereby] argue with you before your Lord?\" Say, \"Indeed, [all] bounty is in the hand[132] of All?h - He grants it to whom He wills. And All?h is all-Encompassing and Wise.\"\n\n**74** (74) He selects for His mercy whom He wills. And All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**75** (75) And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount [of wealth], he will return it to you. And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a [single] coin, he will not return it to you unless you are constantly standing over him [demanding it]. That is because they say, \"There is no blame upon us concerning the unlearned.\"[133] And they speak untruth about All?h while they know [it].\n\n**76** (76) But yes, whoever fulfills his commitment and fears All?h - then indeed, All?h loves those who fear Him.\n\n**77** (77) Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of All?h and their [own] oaths for a small price will have no share in the Hereafter, and All?h will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**78** (78) And indeed, there is among them a party who alter the Scripture with their tongues so you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, \"This is from All?h,\" but it is not from All?h. And they speak untruth about All?h while they know.\n\n**79** (79) It is not for a human [prophet][134] that All?h should give him the Scripture[135] and authority and prophethood and then he would say to the people, \"Be servants to me rather than All?h,\" but [instead, he would say], \"Be pious scholars of the Lord because of what you have taught of the Scripture and because of what you have studied.\"\n\n**8** (8) [Who say], \"Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.[117]\n\n**80** (80) Nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords. Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims?\n\n**81** (81) And [recall, O People of the Scripture], when All?h took the covenant of the prophets, [saying], \"Whatever I give you of the Scripture and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, you [must] believe in him and support him.\" [All?h] said, \"Have you acknowledged and taken upon that My commitment?\"[136] They said, \"We have acknowledged it.\" He said, \"Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.\"\n\n**82** (82) And whoever turned away after that - they were the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**83** (83) So is it other than the religion of All?h they desire, while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned?\n\n**84** (84) Say, \"We have believed in All?h and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants [al-Asb??], and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him.\"\n\n**85** (85) And whoever desires other than Isl?m as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\n\n**86** (86) How shall All?h guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had witnessed that the Messenger is true and clear signs had come to them? And All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n\n**87** (87) Those - their recompense will be that upon them is the curse of All?h and the angels and the people, all together,\n\n**88** (88) Abiding eternally therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved,\n\n**89** (89) Except for those who repent after that[137] and correct themselves. For indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**9** (9) Our Lord, surely You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt. Indeed, All?h does not fail in His promise.\"\n\n**90** (90) Indeed, those who disbelieve [i.e., reject the message] after their belief and then increase in disbelief - never will their [claimed] repentance be accepted, and they are the ones astray.\n\n**91** (91) Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never would the [whole] capacity of the earth in gold be accepted from one of them if he would [seek to] ransom himself with it. For those there will be a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.\n\n**92** (92) Never will you attain the good [reward][138] until you spend [in the way of All?h] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, All?h is Knowing of it.\n\n**93** (93) All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel [i.e., Jacob] had made unlawful to himself before the Torah was revealed. Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"So bring the Torah and recite it, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**94** (94) And whoever invents about All?h untruth after that - then those are [truly] the wrongdoers.\n\n**95** (95) Say, \"All?h has told the truth. So follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of the polytheists.\"[139]\n\n**96** (96) Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah [i.e., Makkah] - blessed and a guidance for the worlds.\n\n**97** (97) In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham. And whoever enters it [i.e., the ?aram] shall be safe. And [due] to All?h from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way. But whoever disbelieves [i.e., refuses] - then indeed, All?h is free from need of the worlds.[140]\n\n**98** (98) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of All?h while All?h is Witness over what you do?\"\n\n**99** (99) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, why do you avert from the way of All?h those who believe, seeking to make it [seem] deviant, while you are witnesses [to the truth]? And All?h is not unaware of what you do.\""

    "slug": "/surahs/surah-004",
    "content": "**1** (1) O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear All?h, through whom[156] you ask one another,[157] and the wombs.[158] Indeed All?h is ever,[159] over you, an Observer.[160]\n\n**10** (10) Indeed, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire. And they will be burned in a Blaze [i.e., Hellfire].\n\n**100** (100) And whoever emigrates for the cause of All?h will find on the earth many [alternative] locations and abundance. And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to All?h and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward has already become incumbent upon All?h. And All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**101** (101) And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer,[215] [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you.[216] Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.\n\n**102** (102) And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among them and lead them in prayer,[217] let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you, taking precaution and carrying their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack. But there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down your arms, but take precaution. Indeed, All?h has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.\n\n**103** (103) And when you have completed the prayer, remember All?h standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.\n\n**104** (104) And do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you should be suffering - so are they suffering as you are suffering, but you expect from All?h that which they expect not. And All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**105** (105) Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book in truth so you may judge between the people by that which All?h has shown you. And do not be for the deceitful an advocate.\n\n**106** (106) And seek forgiveness of All?h. Indeed, All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**107** (107) And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Indeed, All?h loves not one who is a habitually sinful deceiver.\n\n**108** (108) They conceal [their evil intentions and deeds] from the people, but they cannot conceal [them] from All?h, and He is with them [in His knowledge] when they spend the night in such as He does not accept of speech. And ever is All?h, of what they do, encompassing.\n\n**109** (109) Here you are - those who argue on their behalf in [this] worldly life - but who will argue with All?h for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will [then] be their representative?\n\n**11** (11) All?h instructs you concerning your children [i.e., their portions of inheritance]: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one's estate.[164] And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. And if he had brothers [and/or sisters], for his mother is a sixth,[165] after any bequest he [may have] made or debt.[166] Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by All?h. Indeed, All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**110** (110) And whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness of All?h will find All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**111** (111) And whoever earns [i.e., commits] a sin only earns it against himself. And All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**112** (112) But whoever earns an offense or a sin and then blames it on an innocent [person] has taken upon himself a slander and manifest sin.\n\n**113** (113) And if it was not for the favor of All?h upon you, [O Mu?ammad], and His mercy, a group of them would have determined to mislead you. But they do not mislead except themselves, and they will not harm you at all. And All?h has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and has taught you that which you did not know. And ever has the favor of All?h upon you been great.\n\n**114** (114) No good is there in much of their private conversation, except for those who enjoin charity or that which is right or conciliation between people. And whoever does that seeking means to the approval of All?h - then We are going to give him a great reward.\n\n**115** (115) And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken[218] and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination.\n\n**116** (116) Indeed, All?h does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with All?h has certainly gone far astray.\n\n**117** (117) They call upon instead of Him none but female [deities], and they [actually] call upon none but a rebellious Satan,\n\n**118** (118) Whom All?h has cursed. For he had said, \"I will surely take from among Your servants a specific portion.\n\n**119** (119) And I will mislead them, and I will arouse in them [sinful] desires, and I will command them so they will slit the ears of cattle, and I will command them so they will change the creation of All?h.\" And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of All?h has certainly sustained a clear loss.\n\n**12** (12) And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, for you is one fourth of what they leave, after any bequest they [may have] made or debt. And for them [i.e., the wives] is one fourth if you leave no child. But if you leave a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, after any bequest you [may have] made or debt. And if a man or woman leaves neither ascendants nor descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third,[167] after any bequest which was made or debt, as long as there is no detriment [caused].[168] [This is] an ordinance from All?h, and All?h is Knowing and Forbearing.\n\n**120** (120) He [i.e., Satan] promises them and arouses desire in them. But Satan does not promise them except delusion.\n\n**121** (121) The refuge of those will be Hell, and they will not find from it an escape.\n\n**122** (122) But the ones who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. [It is] the promise of All?h, [which is] truth, and who is more truthful than All?h in statement.\n\n**123** (123) It [i.e., Paradise] is not [obtained] by your wishful thinking nor by that of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does a wrong will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides All?h a protector or a helper.\n\n**124** (124) And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while being a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.\n\n**125** (125) And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to All?h while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And All?h took Abraham as an intimate friend.\n\n**126** (126) And to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is All?h, of all things, encompassing.\n\n**127** (127) And they request from you, [O Mu?ammad], a [legal] ruling concerning women. Say, \"All?h gives you a ruling about them and [about] what has been recited to you in the Book concerning the orphan girls to whom you do not give what is decreed for them[219] - and [yet] you desire to marry them - and concerning the oppressed among children and that you maintain for orphans [their rights] in justice.\" And whatever you do of good - indeed, All?h is ever Knowing of it.\n\n**128** (128) And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them - and settlement is best. And present in [human] souls is stinginess.[220] But if you do good and fear All?h - then indeed All?h is ever, of what you do, Aware.\n\n**129** (129) And you will never be able to be equal [in feeling] between wives, even if you should strive [to do so]. So do not incline completely [toward one] and leave another hanging.[221] And if you amend [your affairs] and fear All?h - then indeed, All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**13** (13) These are the limits [set by] All?h, and whoever obeys All?h and His Messenger will be admitted by Him to gardens [in Paradise] under which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein; and that is the great attainment.\n\n**130** (130) But if they separate [by divorce], All?h will enrich each [of them] from His abundance. And ever is All?h Encompassing and Wise.\n\n**131** (131) And to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have instructed those who were given the Scripture before you and yourselves to fear All?h. But if you disbelieve - then to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is All?h Free of need and Praiseworthy.\n\n**132** (132) And to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is All?h as Disposer of affairs.[222]\n\n**133** (133) If He wills, He can do away with you, O people, and bring others [in your place]. And ever is All?h competent to do that.\n\n**134** (134) Whoever desires the reward of this world - then with All?h is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And ever is All?h Hearing and Seeing.\n\n**135** (135) O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for All?h, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, All?h is more worthy of both.[223] So follow not [personal] inclination, lest you not be just. And if you distort [your testimony] or refuse [to give it], then indeed All?h is ever, of what you do, Aware.\n\n**136** (136) O you who have believed, believe[224] in All?h and His Messenger and the Book that He sent down upon His Messenger and the Scripture which He sent down before. And whoever disbelieves in All?h, His angels, His books, His messengers, and the Last Day has certainly gone far astray.\n\n**137** (137) Indeed, those who have believed then disbelieved, then believed then disbelieved, and then increased in disbelief - never will All?h forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way.\n\n**138** (138) Give tidings to the hypocrites that there is for them a painful punishment -\n\n**139** (139) Those who take disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do they seek with them honor [through power]? But indeed, honor belongs to All?h entirely.[225]\n\n**14** (14) And whoever disobeys All?h and His Messenger and transgresses His limits - He will put him into the Fire to abide eternally therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.\n\n**140** (140) And it has already come down to you in the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] that when you hear the verses of All?h [recited], they are denied [by them] and ridiculed; so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation. Indeed, you would then be like them.[226] Indeed, All?h will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers in Hell all together -\n\n**141** (141) Those who wait [and watch] you. Then if you gain a victory from All?h, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" But if the disbelievers have a success, they say [to them], \"Did we not gain the advantage over you, but we protected you from the believers?\" All?h will judge between [all of] you on the Day of Resurrection, and never will All?h give the disbelievers over the believers a way [to overcome them].[227]\n\n**142** (142) Indeed, the hypocrites [think to] deceive All?h, but He is deceiving them. And when they stand for prayer, they stand lazily, showing [themselves to] the people and not remembering All?h except a little,\n\n**143** (143) Wavering between them, [belonging] neither to these [i.e., the believers] nor to those [i.e., the disbelievers]. And whoever All?h sends astray - never will you find for him a way.\n\n**144** (144) O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to give All?h against yourselves a clear case?\n\n**145** (145) Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire - and never will you find for them a helper -\n\n**146** (146) Except for those who repent, correct themselves, hold fast to All?h, and are sincere in their religion for All?h, for those will be with the believers. And All?h is going to give the believers a great reward.\n\n**147** (147) What would All?h do with [i.e., gain from] your punishment if you are grateful and believe? And ever is All?h Appreciative[228] and Knowing.\n\n**148** (148) All?h does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged. And ever is All?h Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**149** (149) If [instead] you show [some] good or conceal it or pardon an offense - indeed, All?h is ever Pardoning and Competent.[229]\n\n**15** (15) Those who commit immorality [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] of your women - bring against them four [witnesses] from among you. And if they testify,[169] confine them [i.e., the guilty women] to houses until death takes them or All?h ordains for them [another] way.[170]\n\n**150** (150) Indeed, those who disbelieve in All?h and His messengers and wish to discriminate between All?h and His messengers and say, \"We believe in some and disbelieve in others,\" and wish to adopt a way in between -\n\n**151** (151) Those are the disbelievers, truly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.\n\n**152** (152) But they who believe in All?h and His messengers and do not discriminate between any of them - to those He is going to give their rewards. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**153** (153) The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven. But they had asked of Moses [even] greater than that and said, \"Show us All?h outright,\" so the thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf [for worship] after clear evidences had come to them, and We pardoned that. And We gave Moses a clear authority.\n\n**154** (154) And We raised over them the mount for [refusal of] their covenant; and We said to them, \"Enter the gate bowing humbly\"; and We said to them, \"Do not transgress on the sabbath\"; and We took from them a solemn covenant.\n\n**155** (155) And [We cursed them][230] for their breaking of the covenant and their disbelief in the signs of All?h and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying, \"Our hearts are wrapped\" [i.e., sealed against reception]. Rather, All?h has sealed them because of their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.[231]\n\n**156** (156) And [We cursed them] for their disbelief and their saying against Mary a great slander[232]\n\n**157** (157) And [for] their saying, \"Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the messenger of All?h.\" And they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain.[233]\n\n**158** (158) Rather, All?h raised him to Himself. And ever is All?h Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**159** (159) And there is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him [i.e., Jesus] before his death.[234] And on the Day of Resurrection he will be against them a witness.\n\n**16** (16) And the two[171] who commit it [i.e., unlawful sexual intercourse] among you - punish [i.e., dishonor] them both. But if they repent and correct themselves, leave them alone. Indeed, All?h is ever Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.\n\n**160** (160) For wrongdoing on the part of the Jews, We made unlawful for them [certain] good foods which had been lawful to them, and for their averting from the way of All?h many [people],\n\n**161** (161) And [for] their taking of usury while they had been forbidden from it, and their consuming of the people's wealth unjustly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.\n\n**162** (162) But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and what was revealed before you. And the establishers of prayer [especially] and the givers of zak?h and the believers in All?h and the Last Day - those We will give a great reward.\n\n**163** (163) Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, the Descendants,[235] Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon; and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].\n\n**164** (164) And [We sent] messengers about whom We have related [their stories] to you before and messengers about whom We have not related to you. And All?h spoke to Moses with [direct] speech.\n\n**165** (165) [We sent] messengers as bringers of good tidings and warners so that mankind will have no argument against All?h after the messengers. And ever is All?h Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**166** (166) But All?h bears witness to that which He has revealed to you. He has sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness [as well]. And sufficient is All?h as Witness.\n\n**167** (167) Indeed, those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of All?h have certainly gone far astray.\n\n**168** (168) Indeed, those who disbelieve and commit wrong [or injustice] - never will All?h forgive them, nor will He guide them to a path,\n\n**169** (169) Except the path of Hell; they will abide therein forever. And that, for All?h, is [always] easy.\n\n**17** (17) The repentance accepted by All?h is only for those who do wrong in ignorance [or carelessness] and then repent soon [after].[172] It is those to whom All?h will turn in forgiveness, and All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**170** (170) O mankind, the Messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe; it is better for you. But if you disbelieve - then indeed, to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. And ever is All?h Knowing and Wise.\n\n**171** (171) O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion[236] or say about All?h except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, was but a messenger of All?h and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul [created at a command] from Him. So believe in All?h and His messengers. And do not say, \"Three\"; desist - it is better for you. Indeed, All?h is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is All?h as Disposer of affairs.\n\n**172** (172) Never would the Messiah disdain to be a servant of All?h, nor would the angels near [to Him]. And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant - He will gather them to Himself all together.\n\n**173** (173) And as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will give them in full their rewards and grant them extra from His bounty. But as for those who disdained and were arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves besides All?h any protector or helper.\n\n**174** (174) O mankind, there has come to you a conclusive proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.[237]\n\n**175** (175) So those who believe in All?h and hold fast to Him - He will admit them to mercy from Himself and bounty and guide them to Himself on a straight path.\n\n**176** (176) They request from you a [legal] ruling. Say, \"All?h gives you a ruling concerning one having neither descendants nor ascendants [as heirs].\" If a man dies, leaving no child but [only] a sister, she will have half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she [dies and] has no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will have two thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and sisters, the male will have the share of two females.[238] All?h makes clear to you [His law], lest you go astray. And All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**18** (18) But repentance is not [accepted] of those who [continue to] do evil deeds up until, when death comes to one of them, he says, \"Indeed, I have repented now,\" or of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.\n\n**19** (19) O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion.[173] And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them[174] unless they commit a clear immorality [i.e., adultery]. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and All?h makes therein much good.\n\n**2** (2) And give to the orphans their properties and do not substitute the defective [of your own] for the good [of theirs]. And do not consume their properties into your own. Indeed, that is ever a great sin.\n\n**20** (20) But if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount [in gifts], do not take [back] from it anything. Would you take it in injustice and manifest sin?\n\n**21** (21) And how could you take it while you have gone in unto each other and they have taken from you a solemn covenant?\n\n**22** (22) And do not marry those [women] whom your fathers married, except what has already occurred.[175] Indeed, it was an immorality and hateful [to All?h] and was evil as a way.\n\n**23** (23) Prohibited to you [for marriage] are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father's sisters, your mother's sisters, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your [milk] mothers who nursed you, your sisters through nursing, your wives' mothers, and your step-daughters under your guardianship [born] of your wives unto whom you have gone in. But if you have not gone in unto them, there is no sin upon you. And [also prohibited are] the wives of your sons who are from your [own] loins, and that you take [in marriage] two sisters simultaneously, except for what has already occurred.[176] Indeed, All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**24** (24) And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except those your right hands possess.[177] [This is] the decree of All?h upon you. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, [provided] that you seek them [in marriage] with [gifts from] your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse. So for whatever you enjoy [of marriage] from them, give them their due compensation[178] as an obligation. And there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree to beyond the obligation. Indeed, All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**25** (25) And whoever among you cannot [find] the means to marry free, believing women, then [he may marry] from those whom your right hands possess of believing slave girls. And All?h is most knowing about your faith. You [believers] are of one another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their due compensation [i.e., mahr] according to what is acceptable. [They should be] chaste, neither [of] those who commit unlawful intercourse randomly nor those who take [secret] lovers. But once they are sheltered in marriage, if they should commit adultery, then for them is half the punishment for free [unmarried] women. This [allowance] is for him among you who fears affliction [i.e., sin], but to be patient is better for you. And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**26** (26) All?h wants to make clear to you [the lawful from the unlawful] and guide you to the [good] practices of those before you and to accept your repentance. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**27** (27) All?h wants to accept your repentance, but those who follow [their] passions want you to digress [into] a great deviation.\n\n**28** (28) And All?h wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind was created weak.\n\n**29** (29) O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly[179] but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves [or one another]. Indeed, All?h is to you ever Merciful.\n\n**3** (3) And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hands possess [i.e., slaves]. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\n\n**30** (30) And whoever does that in aggression and injustice - then We will drive him into a Fire. And that, for All?h, is [always] easy.\n\n**31** (31) If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance [into Paradise].\n\n**32** (32) And do not wish for that by which All?h has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of[180] what they have earned. And ask All?h of His bounty. Indeed All?h is ever, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**33** (33) And for all, We have made heirs to what is left by parents and relatives. And to those whom your oaths have bound [to you] - give them their share.[181] Indeed All?h is ever, over all things, a Witness.\n\n**34** (34) Men are in charge of women[182] by [right of] what All?h has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what All?h would have them guard.[183] But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance[184] - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them [lightly].[185] But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, All?h is ever Exalted and Grand.\n\n**35** (35) And if you fear dissension between the two, send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, All?h will cause it between them. Indeed, All?h is ever Knowing and Aware.\n\n**36** (36) Worship All?h and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the near neighbor, the neighbor farther away, the companion at your side,[186] the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, All?h does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful,\n\n**37** (37) Who are stingy and enjoin upon [other] people stinginess and conceal what All?h has given them of His bounty - and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment -\n\n**38** (38) And [also] those who spend of their wealth to be seen by the people and believe not in All?h nor in the Last Day. And he to whom Satan is a companion - then evil is he as a companion.\n\n**39** (39) And what [harm would come] upon them if they believed in All?h and the Last Day and spent out of what All?h provided for them? And All?h is ever, about them, Knowing.\n\n**4** (4) And give the women [upon marriage] their [bridal] gifts[161] graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it, then take it in satisfaction and ease.[162]\n\n**40** (40) Indeed, All?h does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.\n\n**41** (41) So how [will it be] when We bring from every nation a witness and We bring you, [O Mu?ammad], against these [people] as a witness?\n\n**42** (42) That Day, those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish they could be covered by the earth. And they will not conceal from All?h a [single] statement.\n\n**43** (43) O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying[187] or in a state of jan?bah,[188] except those passing through [a place of prayer], until you have washed [your whole body]. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women [i.e., had sexual intercourse] and find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it]. Indeed, All?h is ever Pardoning[189] and Forgiving.\n\n**44** (44) Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, purchasing error [in exchange for it] and wishing you would lose the way?\n\n**45** (45) And All?h is most knowing of your enemies; and sufficient is All?h as an ally, and sufficient is All?h as a helper.\n\n**46** (46) Among the Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] places [i.e., usages] and say, \"We hear and disobey\" and \"Hear but be not heard\" and \"R??in?,\"[190] twisting their tongues and defaming the religion. And if they had said [instead], \"We hear and obey\" and \"Wait for us [to understand],\" it would have been better for them and more suitable. But All?h has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, except for a few.[191]\n\n**47** (47) O you who were given the Scripture, believe in what We have sent down [to Prophet Mu?ammad (?)], confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them toward their backs or curse them as We cursed the sabbath-breakers.[192] And ever is the matter [i.e., decree] of All?h accomplished.\n\n**48** (48) Indeed, All?h does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with All?h has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.\n\n**49** (49) Have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure? Rather, All?h purifies whom He wills, and injustice is not done to them, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].\n\n**5** (5) And do not give the weak-minded your property,[163] which All?h has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them with it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\n\n**50** (50) Look how they invent about All?h untruth, and sufficient is that as a manifest sin.\n\n**51** (51) Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture, who believe in jibt [superstition] and ??gh?t [false objects of worship] and say about the disbelievers, \"These are better guided than the believers as to the way\"?\n\n**52** (52) Those are the ones whom All?h has cursed; and he whom All?h curses - never will you find for him a helper.\n\n**53** (53) Or have they a share of dominion? Then [if that were so], they would not give the people [even as much as] the speck on a date seed.\n\n**54** (54) Or do they envy people for what All?h has given them of His bounty? But We had already given the family of Abraham the Scripture and wisdom[193] and conferred upon them a great kingdom.\n\n**55** (55) And some among them believed in it,[194] and some among them were averse to it. And sufficient is Hell as a blaze.\n\n**56** (56) Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, All?h is ever Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**57** (57) But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. For them therein are purified spouses, and We will admit them to deepening shade.\n\n**58** (58) Indeed, All?h commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice. Excellent is that which All?h instructs you. Indeed, All?h is ever Hearing and Seeing.\n\n**59** (59) O you who have believed, obey All?h and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to All?h and the Messenger, if you should believe in All?h and the Last Day. That is the best [way] and best in result.\n\n**6** (6) And test the orphans [in their abilities] until they reach marriageable age. Then if you perceive in them sound judgement, release their property to them. And do not consume it excessively and quickly, [anticipating] that they will grow up. And whoever, [when acting as guardian], is self-sufficient should refrain [from taking a fee]; and whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is All?h as Accountant.\n\n**60** (60) Have you not seen those who claim to have believed in what was revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and what was revealed before you? They wish to refer legislation to ??gh?t,[195] while they were commanded to reject it; and Satan wishes to lead them far astray.\n\n**61** (61) And when it is said to them, \"Come to what All?h has revealed and to the Messenger,\" you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion.\n\n**62** (62) So how [will it be] when disaster strikes them because of what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by All?h, \"We intended nothing but good conduct and accommodation.\"\n\n**63** (63) Those are the ones of whom All?h knows what is in their hearts, so turn away from them[196] but admonish them and speak to them a far-reaching [i.e., effective] word.\n\n**64** (64) And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by permission of All?h. And if, when they wronged themselves, they had come to you, [O Mu?ammad], and asked forgiveness of All?h and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found All?h Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.\n\n**65** (65) But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Mu?ammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.\n\n**66** (66) And if We had decreed upon them, \"Kill yourselves\" or \"Leave your homes,\" they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].\n\n**67** (67) And then We would have given them from Us a great reward.\n\n**68** (68) And We would have guided them to a straight path.\n\n**69** (69) And whoever obeys All?h and the Messenger - those will be with the ones upon whom All?h has bestowed favor of the prophets, the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions.\n\n**7** (7) For men is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, and for women is a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, be it little or much - an obligatory share.\n\n**70** (70) That is the bounty from All?h, and sufficient is All?h as Knower.\n\n**71** (71) O you who have believed, take your precaution and [either] go forth in companies or go forth all together.\n\n**72** (72) And indeed, there is among you he who lingers behind; and if disaster strikes you, he says, \"All?h has favored me in that I was not present with them.\"\n\n**73** (73) But if bounty comes to you from All?h, he will surely say, as if [i.e., showing that] there had never been between you and him any affection, \"Oh, I wish I had been with them so I could have attained a great attainment.\"[197]\n\n**74** (74) So let those fight in the cause of All?h who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter. And he who fights in the cause of All?h and is killed or achieves victory - We will bestow upon him a great reward.\n\n**75** (75) And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of All?h and [for] the oppressed among men, women and children who say, \"Our Lord, take us out of this city of oppressive people and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper\"?\n\n**76** (76) Those who believe fight in the cause of All?h, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of ??gh?t.[198] So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.\n\n**77** (77) Have you not seen those who were told, \"Restrain your hands [from fighting][199] and establish prayer and give zak?h\"? But then when battle was ordained for them, at once a party of them feared men as they fear All?h or with [even] greater fear. They said, \"Our Lord, why have You decreed upon us fighting? If only You had postponed [it for] us for a short time.\" Say, \"The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for he who fears All?h. And injustice will not be done to you, [even] as much as a thread [inside a date seed].\"\n\n**78** (78) Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. But if good comes to them, they say, \"This is from All?h\"; and if evil befalls them, they say,[200] \"This is from you.\" Say, \"All [things] are from All?h.\" So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?\n\n**79** (79) What comes to you of good is from All?h, but what comes to you of evil, [O man], is from yourself.[201] And We have sent you, [O Mu?ammad], to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is All?h as Witness.[202]\n\n**8** (8) And when [other] relatives and orphans and the needy are present at the [time of] division, then provide for them [something] out of it [i.e., the estate] and speak to them words of appropriate kindness.\n\n**80** (80) He who obeys the Messenger has obeyed All?h; but those who turn away - We have not sent you over them as a guardian.\n\n**81** (81) And they say, \"[We pledge] obedience.\" But when they leave you, a group of them spend the night determining to do other than what you say. But All?h records what they plan by night. So leave them alone and rely upon All?h. And sufficient is All?h as Disposer of affairs.\n\n**82** (82) Then do they not reflect upon the Qur�?n?[203] If it had been from [any] other than All?h, they would have found within it much contradiction.\n\n**83** (83) And when there comes to them something [i.e., information] about [public] security or fear, they spread it around. But if they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those of authority among them, then the ones who [can] draw correct conclusions from it would have known about it. And if not for the favor of All?h upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, except for a few.\n\n**84** (84) So fight, [O Mu?ammad], in the cause of All?h; you are not held responsible except for yourself. And encourage the believers [to join you] that perhaps All?h will restrain the [military] might of those who disbelieve. And All?h is greater in might and stronger in [exemplary] punishment.[204]\n\n**85** (85) Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share [i.e., reward] therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a portion [i.e., burden] therefrom. And ever is All?h, over all things, a Keeper.[205]\n\n**86** (86) And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]. Indeed All?h is ever, over all things, an Accountant.\n\n**87** (87) All?h - there is no deity except Him. He will surely assemble you for [account on] the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful than All?h in statement.\n\n**88** (88) What is [the matter] with you [that you are] two groups concerning the hypocrites,[206] while All?h has made them fall back [into error and disbelief] for what they earned.[207] Do you wish to guide those whom All?h has sent astray? And he whom All?h sends astray - never will you find for him a way [of guidance].[208]\n\n**89** (89) They wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of All?h. But if they turn away [i.e., refuse], then seize them and kill them [for their betrayal] wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper,\n\n**9** (9) And let those [executors and guardians] fear [injustice] as if they [themselves] had left weak offspring behind and feared for them. So let them fear All?h and speak words of appropriate justice.\n\n**90** (90) Except for those who take refuge with a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty or those who come to you, their hearts strained at [the prospect of] fighting you or fighting their own people. And if All?h had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they remove themselves from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then All?h has not made for you a cause [for fighting] against them.\n\n**91** (91) You will find others who wish to obtain security from you and [to] obtain security from their people. Every time they are returned to [the influence of] disbelief, they fall back into it. So if they do not withdraw from you or offer you peace or restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them. And those - We have made for you against them a clear authorization.\n\n**92** (92) And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment [diyah] presented to his [i.e., the deceased's] family [is required], unless they give [up their right as] charity. But if he [i.e., the deceased] was from a people at war with you and he was a believer - then [only] the freeing of a believing slave; and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty - then a compensation payment presented to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. And whoever does not find [one or cannot afford to buy one] - then [instead], a fast for two months consecutively,[209] [seeking] acceptance of repentance from All?h.[210] And All?h is ever Knowing and Wise.\n\n**93** (93) But whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and All?h has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.\n\n**94** (94) O you who have believed, when you go forth [to fight] in the cause of All?h, investigate; and do not say to one who gives you [a greeting of] peace, \"You are not a believer,\"[211] aspiring for the goods of worldly life; for with All?h are many acquisitions. You [yourselves] were like that before; then All?h conferred His favor [i.e., guidance] upon you, so investigate. Indeed All?h is ever, of what you do, Aware.\n\n**95** (95) Not equal are those believers remaining [at home] - other than the disabled - and the muj?hideen, [who strive and fight] in the cause of All?h with their wealth and their lives. All?h has preferred the muj?hideen through their wealth and their lives over those who remain [behind], by degrees. And to all [i.e., both] All?h has promised the best [reward]. But All?h has preferred the muj?hideen over those who remain [behind] with a great reward -\n\n**96** (96) Degrees [of high position] from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**97** (97) Indeed, those whom the angels take [in death] while wronging themselves[212] - [the angels] will say, \"In what [condition] were you?\" They will say, \"We were oppressed in the land.\" They [the angels] will say, \"Was not the earth of All?h spacious [enough] for you to emigrate therein?\" For those, their refuge is Hell - and evil it is as a destination.\n\n**98** (98) Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to a way[213] -\n\n**99** (99) For those it is expected that All?h will pardon them, and All?h is ever Pardoning[214] and Forgiving."

    "content": "**1** (1) O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts.[239] Lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock except for that which is recited to you [in this Qur�?n] - hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of i?r?m.[240] Indeed, All?h ordains what He intends.\n\n**10** (10) But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire.\n\n**100** (100) Say, \"Not equal are the evil and the good, although the abundance of evil might impress you.\" So fear All?h, O you of understanding, that you may be successful.\n\n**101** (101) O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are shown to you, will distress you. But if you ask about them while the Qur�?n is being revealed, they will be shown to you. All?h has pardoned it [i.e., that which is past]; and All?h is Forgiving and Forbearing.\n\n**102** (102) A people asked such [questions] before you; then they became thereby disbelievers.[287]\n\n**103** (103) All?h has not appointed [such innovations as] ba??rah or s?�ibah or wa??lah or ??m.[288] But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about All?h, and most of them do not reason.\n\n**104** (104) And when it is said to them, \"Come to what All?h has revealed and to the Messenger,\" they say, \"Sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers.\" Even though their fathers knew nothing, nor were they guided?\n\n**105** (105) O you who have believed, upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves. Those who have gone astray will not harm you when you have been guided. To All?h is your return all together; then He will inform you of what you used to do.\n\n**106** (106) O you who have believed, testimony [should be taken] among you when death approaches one of you at the time of bequest - [that of] two just men from among you or two others from outside if you are traveling through the land and the disaster of death should strike you. Detain them after the prayer and let them both swear by All?h if you doubt [their testimony, saying], \"We will not exchange it [i.e., our oath] for a price [i.e., worldly gain], even if he should be a near relative, and we will not withhold the testimony of [i.e., ordained by] All?h. Indeed, we would then be of the sinful.\"\n\n**107** (107) But if it is found that those two were guilty of sin [i.e., perjury], let two others stand in their place [who are] foremost [in claim] from those who have a lawful right. And let them swear by All?h, \"Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed. Indeed, we would then be of the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**108** (108) That is more likely that they will give testimony according to its [true] objective, or [at least] they would fear that [other] oaths might be taken after their oaths. And fear All?h and listen [i.e., obey Him]; and All?h does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.\n\n**109** (109) [Be warned of] the Day when All?h will assemble the messengers and say, \"What was the response you received?\" They will say, \"We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen\" -\n\n**11** (11) O you who have believed, remember the favor of All?h upon you when a people determined to extend their hands [in aggression] against you, but He withheld their hands from you; and fear All?h. And upon All?h let the believers rely.\n\n**110** (110) [The Day] when All?h will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Pure Spirit [i.e., the angel Gabriel] and you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and [remember] when I taught you writing and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when you designed from clay [what was] like the form of a bird with My permission, then you breathed into it, and it became a bird with My permission; and you healed the blind [from birth] and the leper with My permission; and when you brought forth the dead with My permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from [killing] you when you came to them with clear proofs and those who disbelieved among them said, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"\n\n**111** (111) And [remember] when I inspired to the disciples, \"Believe in Me and in My messenger [i.e., Jesus].\" They said, \"We have believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims [in submission to All?h].\"\n\n**112** (112) [And remember] when the disciples said, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord[289] send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven?\" [Jesus] said, \"Fear All?h, if you should be believers.\"\n\n**113** (113) They said, \"We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses.\"\n\n**114** (114) Said Jesus, the son of Mary, \"O All?h, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.\"\n\n**115** (115) All?h said, \"Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you - then indeed will I punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished anyone among the worlds.\"\n\n**116** (116) And [beware the Day] when All?h will say, \"O Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as deities besides All?h?'\" He will say, \"Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen.\n\n**117** (117) I said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship All?h, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness.\n\n**118** (118) If You should punish them - indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\n**119** (119) All?h will say, \"This is the Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness.\" For them are gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, All?h being pleased with them, and they with Him. That is the great attainment.\n\n**12** (12) And All?h had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We delegated from among them twelve leaders. And All?h said, \"I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zak?h and believe in My messengers and support them and loan All?h a goodly loan,[247] I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever of you disbelieves after that has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\"\n\n**120** (120) To All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is within them. And He is over all things competent.\n\n**13** (13) So for their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hardened. They distort words from their [proper] places [i.e., usages] and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded.[248] And you will still observe deceit among them, except a few of them. But pardon them and overlook [their misdeeds]. Indeed, All?h loves the doers of good.\n\n**14** (14) And from those who say, \"We are Christians\" We took their covenant; but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded.[249] So We caused among them[250] animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And All?h is going to inform them about what they used to do.\n\n**15** (15) O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much.[251] There has come to you from All?h a light and a clear Book [i.e., the Qur�?n]\n\n**16** (16) By which All?h guides those who pursue His pleasure to the ways of peace[252] and brings them out from darknesses into the light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path.\n\n**17** (17) They have certainly disbelieved who say that All?h is Christ, the son of Mary. Say, \"Then who could prevent All?h at all if He had intended to destroy Christ, the son of Mary, or his mother or everyone on the earth?\" And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**18** (18) But the Jews and the Christians say, \"We are the children of All?h and His beloved.\" Say, \"Then why does He punish you for your sins?\" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the [final] destination.\n\n**19** (19) O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger to make clear to you [the religion] after a period [of suspension] of messengers, lest you say, \"There came not to us any bringer of good tidings or a warner.\" But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**2** (2) O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of All?h or [the sanctity of] the sacred month or [neglect the marking of] the sacrificial animals and garlanding [them] or [violate the safety of] those coming to the Sacred House seeking bounty from their Lord and [His] approval. But when you come out of i?r?m, then [you may] hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people for having obstructed you from al-Masjid al-?ar?m lead you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear All?h; indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**20** (20) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Moses said to his people, \"O my people, remember the favor of All?h upon you when He appointed among you prophets and made you possessors[253] and gave you that which He had not given anyone among the worlds.\n\n**21** (21) O my people, enter the blessed land [i.e., Palestine] which All?h has assigned to you and do not turn back [from fighting in All?h's cause] and [thus] become losers.\"\n\n**22** (22) They said, \"O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrannical strength, and indeed, we will never enter it until they leave it; but if they leave it, then we will enter.\"\n\n**23** (23) Said two men from those who feared [to disobey] upon whom All?h had bestowed favor, \"Enter upon them through the gate, for when you have entered it, you will be predominant.[254] And upon All?h rely, if you should be believers.\"\n\n**24** (24) They said, \"O Moses, indeed we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are within it; so go, you and your Lord, and fight. Indeed, we are remaining right here.\"\n\n**25** (25) [Moses] said, \"My Lord, indeed I do not possess [i.e., control] except myself and my brother, so part us[255] from the defiantly disobedient people.\"\n\n**26** (26) [All?h] said, \"Then indeed, it is forbidden to them for forty years [in which] they will wander throughout the land. So do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people.\"\n\n**27** (27) And recite to them the story of Adam's two sons, in truth, when they both made an offering [to All?h], and it was accepted from one of them but was not accepted from the other. Said [the latter], \"I will surely kill you.\" Said [the former], \"Indeed, All?h only accepts from the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n**28** (28) If you should raise your hand toward me to kill me - I shall not raise my hand toward you to kill you. Indeed, I fear All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**29** (29) Indeed, I want you to obtain [thereby] my sin and your sin so you will be among the companions of the Fire. And that is the recompense of wrongdoers.\"\n\n**3** (3) Prohibited to you are dead animals,[241] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All?h, and [those animals] killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars,[242] and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience. This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Isl?m as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin - then indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**30** (30) And his soul permitted to him[256] the murder of his brother, so he killed him and became among the losers.\n\n**31** (31) Then All?h sent a crow searching [i.e., scratching] in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace[257] of his brother. He said, \"O woe to me! Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the disgrace [i.e., body] of my brother?\" And he became of the regretful.\n\n**32** (32) Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul[258] or for corruption [done] in the land[259] - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one[260] - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And Our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors.[261]\n\n**33** (33) Indeed, the penalty[262] for those who wage war[263] against All?h and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world; and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment,\n\n**34** (34) Except for those who return [repenting] before you overcome [i.e., apprehend] them. And know that All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**35** (35) O you who have believed, fear All?h and seek the means [of nearness] to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed.\n\n**36** (36) Indeed, those who disbelieve - if they should have all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them, and for them is a painful punishment.\n\n**37** (37) They will wish to get out of the Fire, but never are they to emerge therefrom, and for them is an enduring punishment.\n\n**38** (38) [As for] the thief, the male and the female, amputate their hands in recompense for what they earned [i.e., committed] as a deterrent [punishment] from All?h. And All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**39** (39) But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, All?h will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**4** (4) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], what has been made lawful for them. Say, \"Lawful for you are [all] good foods and [game caught by] what you have trained of hunting animals[243] which you train as All?h has taught you. So eat of what they catch for you, and mention the name of All?h upon it, and fear All?h.\" Indeed, All?h is swift in account.\n\n**40** (40) Do you not know that to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills, and All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**41** (41) O Messenger, let them not grieve you who hasten into disbelief � of those who say, \"We believe\" with their mouths, but their hearts believe not, and from among the Jews. [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, listening to another people who have not come to you.[264] They distort words beyond their [proper] places [i.e., usages], saying, \"If you are given this,[265] take it; but if you are not given it, then beware.\" But he for whom All?h intends fitnah[266] - never will you possess [power to do] for him a thing against All?h. Those are the ones for whom All?h does not intend to purify their hearts. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.\n\n**42** (42) [They are] avid listeners to falsehood, devourers of [what is] unlawful. So if they come to you, [O Mu?ammad], judge between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from them - never will they harm you at all. And if you judge, judge between them with justice. Indeed, All?h loves those who act justly.\n\n**43** (43) But how is it that they come to you for judgement while they have the Torah, in which is the judgement of All?h? Then they turn away, [even] after that; but those are not [in fact] believers.\n\n**44** (44) Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to All?h] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with which they were entrusted of the Scripture of All?h, and they were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price [i.e., worldly gain]. And whoever does not judge by what All?h has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.\n\n**45** (45) And We ordained for them therein a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds is legal retribution. But whoever gives [up his right as] charity, it is an expiation for him. And whoever does not judge by what All?h has revealed - then it is those who are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\n\n**46** (46) And We sent, following in their footsteps,[267] Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him in the Torah; and We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which preceded it of the Torah as guidance and instruction for the righteous.\n\n**47** (47) And let the People of the Gospel judge by what All?h has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what All?h has revealed - then it is those who are the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**48** (48) And We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] in truth, confirming that which preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what All?h has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from what has come to you of the truth. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method.[268] Had All?h willed, He would have made you one nation [united in religion], but [He intended] to test you in what He has given you; so race to [all that is] good.[269] To All?h is your return all together, and He will [then] inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\n\n**49** (49) And judge, [O Mu?ammad], between them by what All?h has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them, lest they tempt you away from some of what All?h has revealed to you. And if they turn away - then know that All?h only intends to afflict them with some of their [own] sins. And indeed, many among the people are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**5** (5) This day [all] good foods have been made lawful, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. And [lawful in marriage are] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation,[244] desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse or taking [secret] lovers. And whoever denies the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.\n\n**50** (50) Then is it the judgement of [the time of] ignorance they desire? But who is better than All?h in judgement for a people who are certain [in faith].\n\n**51** (51) O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, All?h guides not the wrongdoing people.\n\n**52** (52) So you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] hastening into [association with] them, saying, \"We are afraid a misfortune may strike us.\" But perhaps All?h will bring conquest or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they have been concealing within themselves, regretful.\n\n**53** (53) And those who believe will say,[270] \"Are these the ones who swore by All?h their strongest oaths that indeed they were with you?\" Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers.\n\n**54** (54) O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - All?h will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, strong against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of All?h and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the favor of All?h; He bestows it upon whom He wills. And All?h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\n\n**55** (55) Your ally is none but All?h and [therefore] His Messenger and those who have believed - those who establish prayer and give zak?h, and they bow [in worship].\n\n**56** (56) And whoever is an ally of All?h and His Messenger and those who have believed - indeed, the party of All?h - they will be the predominant.\n\n**57** (57) O you who have believed, take not those who have taken your religion in ridicule and amusement among the ones who were given the Scripture before you nor the disbelievers as allies. And fear All?h, if you should [truly] be believers.\n\n**58** (58) And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they are a people who do not use reason.\n\n**59** (59) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, do you resent us except [for the fact] that we have believed in All?h and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and because most of you are defiantly disobedient?\"\n\n**6** (6) O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of jan?bah,[245] then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women[246] and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. All?h does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.\n\n**60** (60) Say, \"Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that[271] as penalty from All?h? [It is that of] those whom All?h has cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs and slaves of ??gh?t.[272] Those are worse in position and further astray from the sound way.\"\n\n**61** (61) And when they come to you, they say, \"We believe.\" But they have entered with disbelief [in their hearts], and they have certainly left with it. And All?h is most knowing of what they were concealing.\n\n**62** (62) And you see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and the devouring of [what is] unlawful. How wretched is what they have been doing.\n\n**63** (63) Why do the rabbis and religious scholars not forbid them from saying what is sinful and devouring what is unlawful? How wretched is what they have been practicing.\n\n**64** (64) And the Jews say, \"The hand of All?h is chained.\"[273] Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, both His hands are extended; He spends however He wills. And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war [against you], All?h extinguished it. And they strive throughout the land [causing] corruption, and All?h does not like corrupters.\n\n**65** (65) And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and feared All?h, We would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to Gardens of Pleasure.\n\n**66** (66) And if only they had upheld [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to them from their Lord [i.e., the Qur�?n], they would have consumed [provision] from above them and from beneath their feet.[274] Among them are a moderate [i.e., acceptable] community, but many of them - evil is that which they do.\n\n**67** (67) O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And All?h will protect you from the people. Indeed, All?h does not guide the disbelieving people.\n\n**68** (68) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, you are [standing] on nothing until you uphold [the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord [i.e., the Qur�?n].\" And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the disbelieving people.\n\n**69** (69) Indeed, those who have believed [in Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] and those [before him (?)] who were Jews or Sabeans or Christians - those [among them] who believed in All?h and the Last Day and did righteousness - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.[275]\n\n**7** (7) And remember the favor of All?h upon you and His covenant with which He bound you when you said, \"We hear and we obey\"; and fear All?h. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**70** (70) We had already taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and had sent to them messengers. Whenever there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party [of messengers] they denied, and another party they killed.\n\n**71** (71) And they thought there would be no [resulting] punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Then All?h turned to them in forgiveness; then [again] many of them became blind and deaf. And All?h is Seeing of what they do.\n\n**72** (72) They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"All?h is the Messiah, the son of Mary\" while the Messiah has said, \"O Children of Israel, worship All?h, my Lord and your Lord.\" Indeed, he who associates others with All?h - All?h has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.\n\n**73** (73) They have certainly disbelieved who say, \"All?h is the third of three.\"[276] And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.\n\n**74** (74) So will they not repent to All?h and seek His forgiveness? And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**75** (75) The Messiah, son of Mary, was not but a messenger; [other] messengers have passed on before him. And his mother was a supporter of truth. They both used to eat food.[277] Look how We make clear to them the signs; then look how they are deluded.\n\n**76** (76) Say, \"Do you worship besides All?h that which holds for you no [power of] harm or benefit while it is All?h who is the Hearing, the Knowing?\"\n\n**77** (77) Say, \"O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and have strayed from the soundness of the way.\"\n\n**78** (78) Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and of Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and [habitually] transgressed.\n\n**79** (79) They used not to prevent one another from wrongdoing that they did. How wretched was that which they were doing.\n\n**8** (8) O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for All?h, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear All?h; indeed, All?h is [fully] Aware of what you do.\n\n**80** (80) You see many of them becoming allies of those who disbelieved [i.e., the polytheists]. How wretched is that which they have put forth for themselves in that All?h has become angry with them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally.\n\n**81** (81) And if they had believed in All?h and the Prophet and in what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies; but many of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**82** (82) You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers [to be] the Jews and those who associate others with All?h; and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, \"We are Christians.\" That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.\n\n**83** (83) And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, \"Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses.\n\n**84** (84) And why should we not believe in All?h and what has come to us of the truth? And we aspire that our Lord will admit us [to Paradise] with the righteous people.\"\n\n**85** (85) So All?h rewarded them for what they said[278] with gardens [in Paradise] beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of doers of good.\n\n**86** (86) But those who disbelieved and denied Our signs - they are the companions of Hellfire.\n\n**87** (87) O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which All?h has made lawful to you and do not transgress. Indeed, All?h does not like transgressors.\n\n**88** (88) And eat of what All?h has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And fear All?h, in whom you are believers.\n\n**89** (89) All?h will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless[279] in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its expiation[280] is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths.[281] Thus does All?h make clear to you His verses [i.e., revealed law] that you may be grateful.\n\n**9** (9) All?h has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds [that] for them there is forgiveness and great reward.\n\n**90** (90) O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than All?h], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid[282] it that you may be successful.\n\n**91** (91) Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of All?h and from prayer. So will you not desist?\n\n**92** (92) And obey All?h and obey the Messenger and beware. And if you turn away - then know that upon Our Messenger is only [the responsibility for] clear notification.\n\n**93** (93) There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear All?h and believe and do righteous deeds, and then fear All?h and believe, and then fear All?h and do good; and All?h loves the doers of good.\n\n**94** (94) O you who have believed, All?h will surely test you through something of the game that your hands and spears [can] reach, that All?h may make evident those who fear Him unseen. And whoever transgresses after that - for him is a painful punishment.\n\n**95** (95) O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in the state of i?r?m.[283] And whoever of you kills it intentionally - the penalty is an equivalent from sacrificial animals to what he killed, as judged by two just men among you as an offering [to All?h] delivered to the Ka?bah, or an expiation: the feeding of needy people or the equivalent of that in fasting, that he may taste the consequence of his matter [i.e., deed]. All?h has pardoned what is past; but whoever returns [to violation], then All?h will take retribution from him. And All?h is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.[284]\n\n**96** (96) Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and the travelers,[285] but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of i?r?m. And fear All?h to whom you will be gathered.\n\n**97** (97) All?h has made the Ka?bah, the Sacred House, standing[286] for the people and [has sanctified] the sacred months and the sacrificial animals and the garlands [by which they are identified]. That is so you may know that All?h knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth and that All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**98** (98) Know that All?h is severe in penalty and that All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**99** (99) Not upon the Messenger is [responsibility] except [for] notification. And All?h knows whatever you reveal and whatever you conceal."

    "content": "**1** (1) [All] praise is [due] to All?h, who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light. Then those who disbelieve equate [others] with their Lord.\n\n**10** (10) And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by that which they used to ridicule.\n\n**100** (100) But they have attributed to All?h partners - the jinn, while He has created them - and have fabricated for Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Exalted is He and high above what they describe.\n\n**101** (101) [He is] Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He does not have a companion [i.e., wife] and He created all things? And He is, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**102** (102) That is All?h, your Lord; there is no deity except Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is Disposer of all things.\n\n**103** (103) Vision perceives Him not,[332] but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle,[333] the Aware.[334]\n\n**104** (104) There has come to you enlightenment from your Lord. So whoever will see does so for [the benefit of] his soul, and whoever is blind [does harm] against it. And [say], \"I am not a guardian over you.\"[335]\n\n**105** (105) And thus do We diversify the verses so they [i.e., the disbelievers] will say, \"You have studied,\"[336] and so We may make it [i.e., the Qur�?n] clear for a people who know.\n\n**106** (106) Follow, [O Mu?ammad], what has been revealed to you from your Lord - there is no deity except Him - and turn away from those who associate others with All?h.\n\n**107** (107) But if All?h had willed, they would not have associated. And We have not appointed you over them as a guardian, nor are you a manager over them.[337]\n\n**108** (108) And do not insult those they invoke other than All?h, lest they insult All?h in enmity without knowledge. Thus We have made pleasing to every community their deeds. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they used to do.\n\n**109** (109) And they swear by All?h their strongest oaths that if a sign came to them, they would surely believe in it. Say, \"The signs are only with [i.e., from] All?h.\" And what will make you perceive that even if it [i.e., a sign] came, they would not believe.\n\n**11** (11) Say, \"Travel through the land; then observe how was the end of the deniers.\"\n\n**110** (110) And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they refused to believe in it [i.e., the revelation] the first time. And We will leave them in their transgression, wandering blindly.\n\n**111** (111) And even if We had sent down to them the angels [with the message] and the dead spoke to them [of it] and We gathered together every [created] thing in front of them, they would not believe unless All?h should will. But most of them, [of that], are ignorant.\n\n**112** (112) And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.\n\n**113** (113) And [it is] so the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter will incline toward it [i.e., deceptive speech] and that they will be satisfied with it and that they will commit that which they are committing.\n\n**114** (114) [Say], \"Then is it other than All?h I should seek as judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] explained in detail?\" And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in truth, so never be among the doubters.\n\n**115** (115) And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**116** (116) And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of All?h. They follow not except assumption, and they are not but misjudging.[338]\n\n**117** (117) Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who strays from His way, and He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.\n\n**118** (118) So eat of that [meat] upon which the name of All?h has been mentioned,[339] if you are believers in His verses [i.e., revealed law].\n\n**119** (119) And why should you not eat of that upon which the name of All?h has been mentioned while He has explained in detail to you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you are compelled.[340] And indeed do many lead [others] astray through their [own] inclinations without knowledge. Indeed, your Lord - He is most knowing of the transgressors.\n\n**12** (12) Say, \"To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?\" Say, \"To All?h.\" He has decreed upon Himself mercy. He will surely assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. Those who will lose themselves [that Day] do not believe.\n\n**120** (120) And leave [i.e., desist from] what is apparent of sin and what is concealed thereof. Indeed, those who earn [blame for] sin will be recompensed for that which they used to commit.\n\n**121** (121) And do not eat of that upon which the name of All?h has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. And indeed do the devils inspire their allies [among men] to dispute with you. And if you were to obey them, indeed, you would be associators [of others with Him].[341]\n\n**122** (122) And is one who was dead and We gave him life and made for him light by which to walk among the people like one who is in darkness, never to emerge therefrom? Thus it has been made pleasing to the disbelievers that which they were doing.\n\n**123** (123) And thus We have placed within every city the greatest of its criminals to conspire therein. But they conspire not except against themselves, and they perceive [it] not.\n\n**124** (124) And when a sign comes to them, they say, \"Never will we believe until we are given like that which was given to the messengers of All?h.\" All?h is most knowing of where [i.e., with whom] He places His message. There will afflict those who committed crimes debasement before All?h and severe punishment for what they used to conspire.\n\n**125** (125) So whoever All?h wants to guide - He expands his breast to [contain] Isl?m; and whoever He wants to send astray[342] - He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does All?h place defilement upon those who do not believe.\n\n**126** (126) And this is the path of your Lord, [leading] straight. We have detailed the verses for a people who remember.\n\n**127** (127) For them will be the Home of Peace [i.e., Paradise] with their Lord. And He will be their protecting friend because of what they used to do.\n\n**128** (128) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], the Day when He will gather them together [and say], \"O company of jinn, you have [misled] many of mankind.\" And their allies among mankind will say, \"Our Lord, some of us made use of others, and we have [now] reached our term which You appointed for us.\" He will say, \"The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what All?h wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.\"\n\n**129** (129) And thus will We make some of the wrongdoers allies of others for what they used to earn.[343]\n\n**13** (13) And to Him belongs that which reposes by night and by day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**130** (130) \"O company of jinn and mankind,[344] did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\" They will say, \"We bear witness against ourselves\"; and the worldly life had deluded them, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.\n\n**131** (131) That is because your Lord would not destroy the cities for wrongdoing[345] while their people were unaware.\n\n**132** (132) And for all are degrees [i.e., positions resulting] from what they have done. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do.\n\n**133** (133) And your Lord is the Free of need, the possessor of mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and give succession after you to whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people.\n\n**134** (134) Indeed, what you are promised is coming, and you will not cause failure [to All?h].[346]\n\n**135** (135) Say, \"O my people, work according to your position; [for] indeed, I am working. And you are going to know who will have succession in the home.[347] Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.\"\n\n**136** (136) And they [i.e., the polytheists] assign to All?h from that which He created of crops and livestock a share and say, \"This is for All?h,\" by their claim, \"and this is for our 'partners' [associated with Him].\" But what is for their \"partners\" does not reach All?h, while what is for All?h - this reaches their \"partners.\" Evil is that which they rule.\n\n**137** (137) And likewise, to many of the polytheists their partners[348] have made [to seem] pleasing the killing of their children in order to bring about their destruction and to cover them with confusion in their religion. And if All?h had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them and that which they invent.\n\n**138** (138) And they say, \"These animals[349] and crops are forbidden; no one may eat from them except whom we will,\" by their claim. And there are those [camels] whose backs are forbidden [by them][350] and those upon which the name of All?h is not mentioned[351] - [all of this] an invention of untruth about Him.[352] He will punish them for what they were inventing.\n\n**139** (139) And they say, \"What is in the bellies of these animals[353] is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females. But if it is [born] dead, then all of them have shares therein.\" He will punish them for their description.[354] Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.\n\n**14** (14) Say, \"Is it other than All?h I should take as a protector, Creator of the heavens and earth, while it is He who feeds and is not fed?\" Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first [among you] who submit [to All?h] and [was commanded], 'Do not ever be of the polytheists.'\"\n\n**140** (140) They will have lost who killed their children in foolishness without knowledge and prohibited what All?h had provided for them, inventing untruth about All?h. They have gone astray and were not [rightly] guided.\n\n**141** (141) And He it is who causes gardens to grow, [both] trellised and untrellised, and palm trees and crops of different [kinds of] food and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. Eat of [each of] its fruit when it yields and give its due [zak?h] on the day of its harvest. And be not excessive.[355] Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess.\n\n**142** (142) And of the grazing livestock are carriers [of burdens] and those [too] small. Eat of what All?h has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan.[356] Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.\n\n**143** (143) [They are] eight mates - of the sheep, two and of the goats, two. Say, \"Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**144** (144) And of the camels, two and of the cattle, two. Say, \"Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when All?h charged you with this? Then who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about All?h to mislead the people by [something] other than knowledge? Indeed, All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**145** (145) Say, \"I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or it be [that slaughtered in] disobedience, dedicated to other than All?h.[357] But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], then indeed, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**146** (146) And to those who are Jews We prohibited every animal of uncloven hoof; and of the cattle and the sheep We prohibited to them their fat, except what adheres to their backs or the entrails or what is joined with bone. [By] that We repaid them for their transgression. And indeed, We are truthful.\n\n**147** (147) So if they deny you, [O Mu?ammad], say, \"Your Lord is the possessor of vast mercy; but His punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals.\"\n\n**148** (148) Those who associated [others] with All?h will say, \"If All?h had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything.\" Likewise did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, \"Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but misjudging.\"\n\n**149** (149) Say, \"With All?h is the far-reaching [i.e., conclusive] argument. If He had willed, He would have guided you all.\"\n\n**15** (15) Say, \"Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.\"\n\n**150** (150) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Bring forward your witnesses who will testify that All?h has prohibited this.\" And if they testify, do not testify with them. And do not follow the desires of those who deny Our verses and those who do not believe in the Hereafter, while they equate [others] with their Lord.\n\n**151** (151) Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you. [He commands] that you not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment, and do not kill your children out of poverty; We will provide for you and them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which All?h has forbidden [to be killed] except by [legal] right. This has He instructed you that you may use reason.\"\n\n**152** (152) And do not approach the orphan's property except in a way that is best [i.e., intending improvement] until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice. We do not charge any soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak [i.e., testify], be just, even if [it concerns] a near relative. And the covenant of All?h fulfill. This has He instructed you that you may remember.\n\n**153** (153) And, [moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way. This has He instructed you that you may become righteous.\n\n**154** (154) Then[358] We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our favor] upon the one who did good [i.e., Moses] and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting with their Lord they would believe.\n\n**155** (155) And this [Qur�?n] is a Book We have revealed [which is] blessed, so follow it and fear All?h that you may receive mercy.\n\n**156** (156) [We revealed it] lest you say, \"The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, but we were of their study unaware,\"\n\n**157** (157) Or lest you say, \"If only the Scripture had been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.\" So there has [now] come to you a clear evidence from your Lord and a guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than one who denies the verses of All?h and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst of punishment for their having turned away.\n\n**158** (158) Do they [then] wait for anything except that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come or that there come some of the signs[359] of your Lord? The Day that some of the signs of your Lord will come no soul will benefit from its faith as long as it had not believed before or had earned through its faith some good. Say, \"Wait. Indeed, we [also] are waiting.\"\n\n**159** (159) Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you, [O Mu?ammad], are not [associated] with them in anything. Their affair is only [left] to All?h; then He will inform them about what they used to do.\n\n**16** (16) He from whom it is averted that Day - [All?h] has granted him mercy. And that is the clear attainment.\n\n**160** (160) Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof [to his credit], and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof; and they will not be wronged.[360]\n\n**161** (161) Say, \"Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path - a correct religion - the way of Abraham, inclining toward truth. And he was not among those who associated others with All?h.\"\n\n**162** (162) Say, \"Indeed, my prayer, my rites of sacrifice, my living and my dying are for All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**163** (163) No partner has He. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first [among you] of the Muslims.\"[361]\n\n**164** (164) Say, \"Is it other than All?h I should desire as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? And every soul earns not [blame] except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ.\"\n\n**165** (165) And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that He may try you through what He has given you. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**17** (17) And if All?h should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him. And if He touches you with good - then He is over all things competent.\n\n**18** (18) And He is the subjugator over His servants. And He is the Wise,[296] the Aware.[297]\n\n**19** (19) Say, \"What thing is greatest in testimony?\" Say, \"All?h is witness between me and you. And this Qur�?n was revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches.[298] Do you [truly] testify that with All?h there are other deities?\" Say, \"I will not testify [with you].\" Say, \"Indeed, He is but one God, and indeed, I am free of what you associate [with Him].\"\n\n**2** (2) It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term[291] and a specified time [known] to Him;[292] then [still] you are in dispute.\n\n**20** (20) Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize it[299] as they recognize their [own] sons. Those who will lose themselves [in the Hereafter] do not believe.\n\n**21** (21) And who is more unjust than one who invents about All?h a lie or denies His verses? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed.\n\n**22** (22) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], the Day We will gather them all together; then We will say to those who associated others with All?h, \"Where are your 'partners' that you used to claim [with Him]?\"\n\n**23** (23) Then there will be no [excuse upon] examination except they will say, \"By All?h, our Lord, we were not those who associated.\"\n\n**24** (24) See how they will lie about themselves. And lost from them will be what they used to invent.\n\n**25** (25) And among them are those who listen to you,[300] but We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. Even when they come to you arguing with you, those who disbelieve say, \"This is not but legends of the former peoples.\"\n\n**26** (26) And they prevent [others] from him and are [themselves] remote from him. And they do not destroy except themselves, but they perceive [it] not.\n\n**27** (27) If you could but see when they are made to stand before the Fire and will say, \"Oh, would that we could be returned [to life on earth] and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers.\"\n\n**28** (28) But what they concealed before has [now] appeared to them. And even if they were returned, they would return to that which they were forbidden; and indeed, they are liars.\n\n**29** (29) And they say, \"There is none but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected.\"\n\n**3** (3) And He is All?h, [the only deity] in the heavens and the earth. He knows your secret and what you make public, and He knows that which you earn.\n\n**30** (30) If you could but see when they will be made to stand before their Lord. He will say, \"Is this not the truth?\" They will say, \"Yes, by our Lord.\" He will [then] say, \"So taste the punishment for what you used to deny.\"\n\n**31** (31) Those will have lost who deny the meeting with All?h, until when the Hour [of resurrection] comes upon them unexpectedly, they will say, \"Oh, [how great is] our regret over what we neglected concerning it [i.e., the Hour],\" while they bear their burdens [i.e., sins] on their backs. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.\n\n**32** (32) And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear All?h, so will you not reason?\n\n**33** (33) We know that you, [O Mu?ammad], are saddened by what they say. And indeed, they do not call you untruthful, but it is the verses of All?h that the wrongdoers reject.\n\n**34** (34) And certainly were messengers denied before you, but they were patient over the denial, and they were harmed until Our victory came to them. And none can alter the words [i.e., decrees] of All?h. And there has certainly come to you some information about the [previous] messengers.\n\n**35** (35) And if their evasion is difficult for you, then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a stairway into the sky to bring them a sign, [then do so]. But if All?h had willed, He would have united them upon guidance. So never be of the ignorant.\n\n**36** (36) Only those who hear will respond. But the dead[301] - All?h will resurrect them; then to Him they will be returned.\n\n**37** (37) And they say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"Indeed, All?h is Able to send down a sign, but most of them do not know.\"\n\n**38** (38) And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies with its wings except [that they are] communities like you. We have not neglected in the Register[302] a thing. Then unto their Lord they will be gathered.\n\n**39** (39) But those who deny Our verses are deaf and dumb within darknesses. Whomever All?h wills - He sends astray; and whomever He wills - He puts him on a straight path.\n\n**4** (4) And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they turn away therefrom.\n\n**40** (40) Say, \"Have you considered:[303] if there came to you the punishment of All?h or there came to you the Hour - is it other than All?h you would invoke, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**41** (41) No, it is Him [alone] you would invoke, and He would remove that for which you invoked Him if He willed, and you would forget what you associate [with Him].\n\n**42** (42) And We have already sent [messengers] to nations before you, [O Mu?ammad]; then We seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves [to Us].\n\n**43** (43) Then why, when Our punishment came to them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts became hardened, and Satan made attractive to them that which they were doing.\n\n**44** (44) So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded,[304] We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair.\n\n**45** (45) So the people that committed wrong were eliminated. And praise to All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**46** (46) Say, \"Have you considered:[305] if All?h should take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, which deity other than All?h could bring them [back] to you?\" Look how We diversify[306] the verses; then they [still] turn away.\n\n**47** (47) Say, \"Have you considered: if the punishment of All?h should come to you unexpectedly or manifestly,[307] will any be destroyed but the wrongdoing people?\"\n\n**48** (48) And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. So whoever believes and reforms - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**49** (49) But those who deny Our verses - the punishment will touch[308] them for their defiant disobedience.\n\n**5** (5) For they had denied the truth when it came to them, but there is going to reach them the news of what they used to ridicule.[293]\n\n**50** (50) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of All?h or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.\" Say, \"Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Then will you not give thought?\"\n\n**51** (51) And warn by it [i.e., the Qur�?n] those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord - for them besides Him will be no protector and no intercessor - that they might become righteous.\n\n**52** (52) And do not send away those who call upon their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His face [i.e., favor]. Not upon you is anything of their account and not upon them is anything of your account.[309] So were you to send them away, you would [then] be of the wrongdoers.\n\n**53** (53) And thus We have tried some of them through others that they [i.e., the disbelievers] might say, \"Is it these whom All?h has favored among us?\" Is not All?h most knowing of those who are grateful?[310]\n\n**54** (54) And when those come to you who believe in Our verses, say, \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed upon Himself mercy: that any of you who does wrong out of ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself - indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**55** (55) And thus do We detail the verses, and [thus] the way of the criminals will become evident.\n\n**56** (56) Say, \"Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides All?h.\" Say, \"I will not follow your desires, for I would then have gone astray, and I would not be of the [rightly] guided.\"\n\n**57** (57) Say, \"Indeed, I am on clear evidence from my Lord, and you have denied it. I do not have that for which you are impatient.[311] The decision is only for All?h. He relates the truth, and He is the best of deciders.\"\n\n**58** (58) Say, \"If I had that for which you are impatient, the matter would have been decided between me and you, but All?h is most knowing of the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**59** (59) And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.\n\n**6** (6) Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them which We had established upon the earth as We have not established you? And We sent [rain from] the sky upon them in showers and made rivers flow beneath them; then We destroyed them for their sins and brought forth after them a generation of others.\n\n**60** (60) And it is He who takes your souls by night[312] and knows what you have committed by day. Then He revives you therein [i.e., by day] that a specified term[313] may be fulfilled. Then to Him will be your return; then He will inform you about what you used to do.\n\n**61** (61) And He is the subjugator over His servants, and He sends over you guardian-angels until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers [i.e., angels of death] take him, and they do not fail [in their duties].\n\n**62** (62) Then they [i.e., His servants] are returned to All?h, their true Lord. Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of accountants.\n\n**63** (63) Say, \"Who rescues you from the darknesses of the land and sea [when] you call upon Him imploring [aloud] and privately, 'If He should save us from this [crisis], we will surely be among the thankful.'\"\n\n**64** (64) Say, \"It is All?h who saves you from it and from every distress; then you [still] associate others with Him.\"\n\n**65** (65) Say, \"He is the [one] Able to send upon you affliction from above you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you [so you become] sects[314] and make you taste the violence of one another.\" Look how We diversify the signs that they might understand.\n\n**66** (66) But your people have denied it while it is the truth. Say, \"I am not over you a manager [i.e., authority].\"\n\n**67** (67) For every news [i.e., happening] is a finality;[315] and you are going to know.\n\n**68** (68) And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse[316] concerning Our verses, then turn away from them until they enter into another conversation. And if Satan should cause you to forget, then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people.\n\n**69** (69) And those who fear All?h are not held accountable for them [i.e., the disbelievers] at all, but [only for] a reminder - that perhaps they will fear Him.\n\n**7** (7) And even if We had sent down to you, [O Mu?ammad], a written scripture on a page and they touched it with their hands, the disbelievers would say, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"\n\n**70** (70) And leave those who take their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life has deluded. But remind with it [i.e., the Qur�?n], lest a soul be given up to destruction for what it earned; it will have other than All?h no protector and no intercessor. And if it should offer every compensation, it would not be taken from it [i.e., that soul]. Those are the ones who are given to destruction for what they have earned. For them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve.\n\n**71** (71) Say, \"Shall we invoke[317] instead of All?h that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after All?h has guided us? [We would then be] like one whom the devils enticed [to wander] upon the earth confused, [while] he has companions inviting him to guidance, [calling], 'Come to us.'\"[318] Say, \"Indeed, the guidance of All?h is the [only] guidance; and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**72** (72) And to establish prayer and fear Him.\" And it is He to whom you will be gathered.\n\n**73** (73) And it is He who created the heavens and earth in truth. And the day [i.e., whenever] He says, \"Be,\" and it is, His word is the truth.[319] And His is the dominion [on] the Day the Horn is blown. [He is] Knower of the unseen[320] and the witnessed;[321] and He is the Wise, the Aware.\n\n**74** (74) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Abraham said to his father ?zar, \"Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error.\"\n\n**75** (75) And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith].\n\n**76** (76) So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star. He said, \"This is my lord.\"[322] But when it set, he said, \"I like not those that set [i.e., disappear].\"\n\n**77** (77) And when he saw the moon rising, he said, \"This is my lord.\" But when it set, he said, \"Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the people gone astray.\"\n\n**78** (78) And when he saw the sun rising, he said, \"This is my lord; this is greater.\" But when it set, he said, \"O my people, indeed I am free from what you associate with All?h.\n\n**79** (79) Indeed, I have turned my face [i.e., self] toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with All?h.\"\n\n**8** (8) And they say, \"Why was there not sent down to him an angel?\"[294] But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided;[295] then they would not be reprieved.\n\n**80** (80) And his people argued with him. He said, \"Do you argue with me concerning All?h while He has guided me? And I fear not what you associate with Him [and will not be harmed] unless my Lord should will something. My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge; then will you not remember?\n\n**81** (81) And how should I fear what you associate while you do not fear that you have associated with All?h that for which He has not sent down to you any authority? So which of the two parties has more right to security, if you should know?\"\n\n**82** (82) They who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice[323] - those will have security, and they are [rightly] guided.\n\n**83** (83) And that was Our [conclusive] argument which We gave Abraham against his people. We raise by degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.\n\n**84** (84) And We gave to him [i.e., Abraham] Isaac and Jacob - all [of them] We guided. And Noah, We guided before; and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good.\n\n**85** (85) And Zechariah and John and Jesus and Elias - and all were of the righteous.\n\n**86** (86) And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot - and all [of them] We preferred over the worlds.\n\n**87** (87) And [some] among their fathers and their descendants and their brothers - and We chose them and We guided them to a straight path.\n\n**88** (88) That is the guidance of All?h by which He guides whomever He wills of His servants. But if they had associated others with All?h, then worthless for them would be whatever they were doing.\n\n**89** (89) Those are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture and authority and prophethood. But if they [i.e., the disbelievers] deny it, then We have entrusted it to a people who are not therein disbelievers.\n\n**9** (9) And if We had made him [i.e., the messenger] an angel, We would have made him [appear as] a man, and We would have covered them with that in which they cover themselves [i.e., confusion and doubt].\n\n**90** (90) Those are the ones whom All?h has guided, so from their guidance take an example. Say, \"I ask of you for it [i.e., this message] no payment. It is not but a reminder for the worlds.\"\n\n**91** (91) And they did not appraise All?h with true appraisal[324] when they said, \"All?h did not reveal to a human being anything.\" Say, \"Who revealed the Scripture that Moses brought as light and guidance to the people? You [Jews] make it into pages, disclosing [some of] it and concealing much. And you[325] were taught that which you knew not - neither you nor your fathers.\" Say, \"All?h [revealed it].\" Then leave them in their [empty] discourse, amusing themselves.\n\n**92** (92) And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed and confirming what was before it, that you may warn the Mother of Cities [i.e., Makkah] and those around it.[326] Those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they are maintaining their prayers.\n\n**93** (93) And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about All?h or says, \"It has been inspired to me,\" while nothing has been inspired to him, and one who says, \"I will reveal [something] like what All?h revealed.\" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels extend their hands,[327] [saying], \"Discharge your souls! Today you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation for what you used to say against All?h other than the truth and [that] you were, toward His verses, being arrogant.\"\n\n**94** (94) [It will be said to them], \"And you have certainly come to Us alone [i.e., individually] as We created you the first time, and you have left whatever We bestowed upon you behind you. And We do not see with you your 'intercessors' which you claimed that they were among you associates [of All?h]. It has [all] been severed between you,[328] and lost from you is what you used to claim.\"\n\n**95** (95) Indeed, All?h is the cleaver of grain and date seeds.[329] He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living. That is All?h; so how are you deluded?\n\n**96** (96) [He is] the cleaver of daybreak and has made the night for rest and the sun and moon for calculation.[330] That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\n\n**97** (97) And it is He who placed for you the stars that you may be guided by them through the darknesses of the land and sea. We have detailed the signs for a people who know.\n\n**98** (98) And it is He who produced you from one soul and [gave you] a place of dwelling and of storage.[331] We have detailed the signs for a people who understand.\n\n**99** (99) And it is He who sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby the growth of all things. We produce from it greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers. And from the palm trees - of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low. And [We produce] gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied. Look at [each of] its fruit when it yields and [at] its ripening. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe."

    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, Meem, ??d.[363]\n\n**10** (10) And We have certainly established you upon the earth and made for you therein ways of livelihood. Little are you grateful.\n\n**100** (100) Has it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its [previous] people that if We willed, We could afflict them for their sins? But We seal over their hearts so they do not hear.[387]\n\n**101** (101) Those cities - We relate to you, [O Mu?ammad], some of their news. And certainly did their messengers come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe in that which they had denied before.[388] Thus does All?h seal over the hearts of the disbelievers.\n\n**102** (102) And We did not find for most of them any covenant;[389] but indeed, We found most of them defiantly disobedient.\n\n**103** (103) Then We sent after them Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were unjust toward them.[390] So see how was the end of the corrupters.\n\n**104** (104) And Moses said, \"O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds\n\n**105** (105) [Who is] obligated not to say about All?h except the truth. I have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord, so send with me the Children of Israel.\"[391]\n\n**106** (106) [Pharaoh] said, \"If you have come with a sign, then bring it forth, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**107** (107) So he [i.e., Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent, manifest.[392]\n\n**108** (108) And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white [with radiance] for the observers.\n\n**109** (109) Said the eminent among the people of Pharaoh, \"Indeed, this is a learned magician\n\n**11** (11) And We have certainly created you, [O mankind], and given you [human] form. Then We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam\"; so they prostrated, except for Iblees.[364] He was not of those who prostrated.\n\n**110** (110) Who wants to expel you from your land [through magic], so what do you instruct?\"\n\n**111** (111) They said,[393] \"Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers\n\n**112** (112) Who will bring you every learned magician.\"\n\n**113** (113) And the magicians came to Pharaoh. They said, \"Indeed for us is a reward if we are the predominant.\"\n\n**114** (114) He said, \"Yes, and, [moreover], you will be among those made near [to me].\"\n\n**115** (115) They said, \"O Moses, either you throw [your staff], or we will be the ones to throw [first].\"\n\n**116** (116) He said, \"Throw,\" and when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and they presented a great [feat of] magic.[394]\n\n**117** (117) And We inspired to Moses, \"Throw your staff,\" and at once it devoured what they were falsifying.\n\n**118** (118) So the truth was established, and abolished was what they were doing.\n\n**119** (119) And they [i.e., Pharaoh and his people] were overcome right there and became debased.\n\n**12** (12) [All?h] said, \"What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?\" [Satan] said, \"I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay [i.e., earth].\"\n\n**120** (120) And the magicians fell down in prostration [to All?h].\n\n**121** (121) They said, \"We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,\n\n**122** (122) The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"\n\n**123** (123) Said Pharaoh, \"You believed in him[395] before I gave you permission. Indeed, this is a conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom its people. But you are going to know.\n\n**124** (124) I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will surely crucify you all.\"\n\n**125** (125) They said, \"Indeed, to our Lord we will return.\n\n**126** (126) And you do not resent us except because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour upon us patience[396] and let us die as Muslims [in submission to You].\"\n\n**127** (127) And the eminent among the people of Pharaoh said, \"Will you leave Moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?\" [Pharaoh] said, \"We will kill their sons and keep their women alive; and indeed, we are subjugators over them.\"\n\n**128** (128) Said Moses to his people, \"Seek help through All?h and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to All?h. He causes to inherit it whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.\"\n\n**129** (129) They said, \"We have been harmed before you came to us and after you have come to us.\" He said, \"Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and grant you succession in the land and see how you will do.\"\n\n**13** (13) [All?h] said, \"Descend from it [i.e., Paradise], for it is not for you to be arrogant therein. So get out; indeed, you are of the debased.\"\n\n**130** (130) And We certainly seized[397] the people of Pharaoh with years of famine and a deficiency in fruits that perhaps they would be reminded.\n\n**131** (131) But when good [i.e., provision] came to them, they said, \"This is ours [by right].\" And if a bad [condition] struck them, they saw an evil omen in Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their fortune is with All?h, but most of them do not know.\n\n**132** (132) And they said, \"No matter what sign you bring us with which to bewitch us, we will not be believers in you.\"\n\n**133** (133) So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people.\n\n**134** (134) And when the punishment descended upon them, they said, \"O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. If you [can] remove the punishment from us, we will surely believe you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel.\"\n\n**135** (135) But when We removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach,[398] then at once they broke their word.\n\n**136** (136) So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.\n\n**137** (137) And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word [i.e., decree] of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed [all] that Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building.\n\n**138** (138) And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs. They [the Children of Israel] said, \"O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.\" He said, \"Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly.\n\n**139** (139) Indeed, those [worshippers] - destroyed is that in which they are [engaged], and worthless is whatever they were doing.\"\n\n**14** (14) [Satan] said, \"Reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.\"\n\n**140** (140) He said, \"Is it other than All?h I should desire for you as a god[399] while He has preferred you over the worlds?\"\n\n**141** (141) And [recall, O Children of Israel], when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, [who were] afflicting you with the worst torment - killing your sons and keeping your women alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.\n\n**142** (142) And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, \"Take my place among my people, do right [by them],[400] and do not follow the way of the corrupters.\"\n\n**143** (143) And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [All?h] said, \"You will not see Me,[401] but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level,[402] and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, \"Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first [among my people] of the believers.\"[403]\n\n**144** (144) [All?h] said, \"O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words [to you]. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.\"\n\n**145** (145) And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all things - instruction and explanation for all things, [saying], \"Take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient.\"[404]\n\n**146** (146) I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of consciousness,[405] they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them.\n\n**147** (147) Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?\n\n**148** (148) And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers.\n\n**149** (149) And when regret overcame them[406] and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, \"If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers.\"\n\n**15** (15) [All?h] said, \"Indeed, you are of those reprieved.\"\n\n**150** (150) And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, \"How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?\" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head, pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, indeed the people overpowered me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me[407] and do not place me among the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**151** (151) [Moses] said, \"My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the most merciful of the merciful.\"\n\n**152** (152) Indeed, those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world, and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood].\n\n**153** (153) But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed - indeed your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**154** (154) And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took up the tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their Lord.\n\n**155** (155) And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment.[408] And when the earthquake seized them,[409] he said, \"My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before and me [as well]. Would You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is not but Your trial by which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy upon us; and You are the best of forgivers.\n\n**156** (156) And decree for us in this world [that which is] good and [also] in the Hereafter; indeed, we have turned back to You.\" [All?h] said, \"My punishment - I afflict with it whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things.\" So I will decree it [especially] for those who fear Me and give zak?h and those who believe in Our verses-\n\n**157** (157) Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written [i.e., described] in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong and makes lawful for them what is good and forbids them from what is evil and relieves them of their burden[410] and the shackles which were upon them.[411] So they who have believed in him, honored him, supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful.\n\n**158** (158) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of All?h to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death.\" So believe in All?h and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in All?h and His words, and follow him that you may be guided.\n\n**159** (159) And among the people of Moses is a community[412] which guides by truth and by it establishes justice.\n\n**16** (16) [Satan] said, \"Because You have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them [i.e., mankind] on Your straight path.\n\n**160** (160) And We divided them into twelve descendant tribes[413] [as distinct] nations. And We inspired to Moses when his people implored him for water, \"Strike with your staff the stone,\" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Every people [i.e., tribe] knew its watering place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not, but they were [only] wronging themselves.\n\n**161** (161) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when it was said to them, \"Dwell in this city [i.e., Jerusalem] and eat from it wherever you will and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens [i.e., sins],' and enter the gate bowing humbly; We will [then] forgive you your sins. We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\"\n\n**162** (162) But those who wronged among them changed [the words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing.\n\n**163** (163) And ask them about the town that was by the sea - when they transgressed in [the matter of] the sabbath - when their fish came to them openly on their sabbath day, and the day they had no sabbath they did not come to them. Thus did We give them trial because they were defiantly disobedient.\n\n**164** (164) And when a community among them said, \"Why do you advise [or warn] a people whom All?h is [about] to destroy or to punish with a severe punishment?\" they [the advisors] said, \"To be absolved before your Lord and perhaps they may fear Him.\"\n\n**165** (165) And when they [i.e., those advised] forgot that by which they had been reminded, We saved those who had forbidden evil and seized those who wronged, with a wretched punishment, because they were defiantly disobeying.\n\n**166** (166) So when they were insolent about that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, \"Be apes, despised.\"\n\n**167** (167) And [mention] when your Lord declared that He would surely [continue to] send upon them until the Day of Resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst torment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**168** (168) And We divided them throughout the earth into nations. Of them some were righteous, and of them some were otherwise. And We tested them with good [times] and bad that perhaps they would return [to obedience].\n\n**169** (169) And there followed them successors who inherited the Scripture [while] taking the commodities[414] of this lower life and saying, \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And if an offer like it[415] comes to them, they will [again] take it. Was not the covenant of the Scripture [i.e., the Torah] taken from them that they would not say about All?h except the truth, and they studied what was in it? And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear All?h, so will you not use reason?\n\n**17** (17) Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].\"\n\n**170** (170) But those who hold fast to the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] and establish prayer - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers.\n\n**171** (171) And [mention] when We raised the mountain above them as if it was a dark cloud and they were certain that it would fall upon them,[416] [and All?h said], \"Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that you might fear All?h.\"\n\n**172** (172) And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying to them], \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes, we have testified.\" [This] - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, \"Indeed, we were of this unaware.\"\n\n**173** (173) Or [lest] you say, \"It was only that our fathers associated [others in worship] with All?h before, and we were but descendants after them. Then would You destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?\"\n\n**174** (174) And thus do We [explain in] detail the verses, and perhaps they will return.[417]\n\n**175** (175) And recite to them, [O Mu?ammad], the news of him[418] to whom We gave [knowledge of] Our signs, but he detached himself from them; so Satan pursued him, and he became of the deviators.[419]\n\n**176** (176) And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby,[420] but he adhered [instead] to the earth[421] and followed his own desire. So his example is like that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he [still] pants. That is the example of the people who denied Our signs.[422] So relate the stories that perhaps they will give thought.\n\n**177** (177) How evil an example [is that of] the people who denied Our signs and used to wrong themselves.\n\n**178** (178) Whoever All?h guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray[423] - it is those who are the losers.\n\n**179** (179) And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock; rather, they are more astray.[424] It is they who are the heedless.\n\n**18** (18) [All?h] said, \"Depart from it [i.e., Paradise], reproached and expelled. Whoever follows you among them - I will surely fill Hell with you, all together.\"\n\n**180** (180) And to All?h belong the best names, so invoke Him by them. And leave [the company of] those who practice deviation concerning His names.[425] They will be recompensed for what they have been doing.\n\n**181** (181) And among those We created is a community[426] which guides by truth and thereby establishes justice.\n\n**182** (182) But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction][427] from where they do not know.\n\n**183** (183) And I will give them time. Indeed, My plan is firm.\n\n**184** (184) Then do they not give thought? There is in their companion [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] no madness. He is not but a clear warner.\n\n**185** (185) Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that All?h has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near? So in what statement [i.e., message] hereafter will they believe?\n\n**186** (186) Whoever All?h sends astray - there is no guide for him. And He leaves them in their transgression, wandering blindly.\n\n**187** (187) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about the Hour: when is its arrival?[428] Say, \"Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal its time except Him. It lays heavily[429] upon the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except unexpectedly.\" They ask you as if you are familiar with it. Say, \"Its knowledge is only with All?h, but most of the people do not know.\"\n\n**188** (188) Say, \"I hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what All?h has willed. And if I knew the unseen, I could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have touched me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe.\"\n\n**189** (189) It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he[430] might dwell in security with her. And when he [i.e., man] covers her,[431] she carries a light burden [i.e., a pregnancy] and continues therein. And when it becomes heavy, they both invoke All?h, their Lord, \"If You should give us a good[432] [child], we will surely be among the grateful.\"\n\n**19** (19) And \"O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat from wherever you will but do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**190** (190) But when He gives them a good [child], they[433] ascribe partners to Him concerning that which He has given them. Exalted is All?h above what they associate with Him.\n\n**191** (191) Do they associate with Him those who create nothing and they are [themselves] created?\n\n**192** (192) And they [i.e., the false deities] are unable to [give] them help, nor can they help themselves.\n\n**193** (193) And if you [believers] invite them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is all the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent.\n\n**194** (194) Indeed, those you [polytheists] call upon besides All?h are servants [i.e., creations] like you. So call upon them and let them respond to you, if you should be truthful.\n\n**195** (195) Do they have feet by which they walk? Or do they have hands by which they strike? Or do they have eyes by which they see? Or do they have ears by which they hear? Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Call your 'partners' and then conspire against me and give me no respite.\n\n**196** (196) Indeed, my protector is All?h, who has sent down the Book; and He is an ally to the righteous.\n\n**197** (197) And those you call upon besides Him are unable to help you, nor can they help themselves.\"\n\n**198** (198) And if you invite them to guidance, they do not hear; and you see them looking at you while they do not see.\n\n**199** (199) Take what is given freely,[434] enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant.\n\n**2** (2) [This is] a Book revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad] - so let there not be in your breast distress therefrom - that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers.\n\n**20** (20) But Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, \"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.\"\n\n**200** (200) And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in All?h. Indeed, He is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**201** (201) Indeed, those who fear All?h - when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Him] and at once they have insight.\n\n**202** (202) But their brothers[435] - they [i.e., the devils] increase them in error; then they do not stop short.\n\n**203** (203) And when you, [O Mu?ammad], do not bring them a sign [i.e., miracle], they say, \"Why have you not contrived it?\" Say, \"I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This [Qur�?n] is enlightenment from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.\"\n\n**204** (204) So when the Qur�?n is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy.\n\n**205** (205) And remember your Lord within yourself in humility and in fear without being apparent in speech - in the mornings and the evenings. And do not be among the heedless.\n\n**206** (206) Indeed, those who are near your Lord [i.e., the angels] are not prevented by arrogance from His worship, and they exalt Him, and to Him they prostrate.\n\n**21** (21) And he swore [by All?h] to them, \"Indeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors.\"\n\n**22** (22) So he made them fall, through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called to them, \"Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?\"\n\n**23** (23) They said, \"Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.\"\n\n**24** (24) [All?h] said, \"Descend, being to one another enemies. And for you on the earth is a place of settlement and enjoyment [i.e., provision] for a time.\"\n\n**25** (25) He said, \"Therein you will live, and therein you will die, and from it you will be brought forth.\"\n\n**26** (26) O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and as adornment. But the clothing of righteousness - that is best. That is from the signs of All?h that perhaps they will remember.\n\n**27** (27) O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing[365] to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe.\n\n**28** (28) And when they commit an immorality, they say, \"We found our fathers doing it, and All?h has ordered us to do it.\" Say, \"Indeed, All?h does not order immorality. Do you say about All?h that which you do not know?\"\n\n**29** (29) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"My Lord has ordered justice and that you direct yourselves [to the Qiblah] at every place [or time] of prostration, and invoke Him, sincere to Him in religion.\" Just as He originated you, you will return [to life] -\n\n**3** (3) Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies. Little do you remember.\n\n**30** (30) A group [of you] He guided, and a group deserved [to be in] error. Indeed, they [i.e., the latter] had taken the devils as allies instead of All?h while they thought that they were guided.\n\n**31** (31) O children of Adam, take your adornment [i.e., wear your clothing] at every masjid,[366] and eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He likes not those who commit excess.\n\n**32** (32) Say, \"Who has forbidden the adornment of [i.e., from] All?h which He has produced for His servants and the good [lawful] things of provision?\" Say, \"They are for those who believed during the life of this world, exclusively [for them] on the Day of Resurrection.\" Thus do We detail the verses for a people who know.\n\n**33** (33) Say, \"My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin,[367] and oppression without right, and that you associate with All?h that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about All?h that which you do not know.\"\n\n**34** (34) And for every nation is a [specified] term. So when their time has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].\n\n**35** (35) O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you My verses [i.e., scriptures and laws], then whoever fears All?h and reforms - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**36** (36) But the ones who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**37** (37) And who is more unjust than one who invents about All?h a lie or denies His verses? Those will attain their portion of the decree[368] until, when Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to them to take them in death, they will say, \"Where are those you used to invoke besides All?h?\" They will say, \"They have departed from us,\" and will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.\n\n**38** (38) [All?h] will say, \"Enter among nations which had passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire.\" Every time a nation enters, it will curse its sister[369] until, when they have all overtaken one another therein, the last of them[370] will say about the first of them,[371] \"Our Lord, these had misled us, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.\" He will say, \"For each is double, but you do not know.\"\n\n**39** (39) And the first of them will say to the last of them, \"Then you had not any favor over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn.\"\n\n**4** (4) And how many cities have We destroyed, and Our punishment came to them at night or while they were sleeping at noon.\n\n**40** (40) Indeed, those who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - the gates of Heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel enters into the eye of a needle [i.e., never]. And thus do We recompense the criminals.\n\n**41** (41) They will have from Hell a bed and over them coverings [of fire]. And thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.\n\n**42** (42) But those who believed and did righteous deeds - We charge no soul except [within] its capacity. Those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**43** (43) And We will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment,[372] [while] flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, \"Praise to All?h, who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if All?h had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord had come with the truth.\" And they will be called, \"This is Paradise, which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do.\"\n\n**44** (44) And the companions of Paradise will call out to the companions of the Fire, \"We have already found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?\" They will say, \"Yes.\" Then an announcer will announce among them, \"The curse of All?h shall be upon the wrongdoers\n\n**45** (45) Who averted [people] from the way of All?h and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they were, concerning the Hereafter, disbelievers.\"\n\n**46** (46) And between them will be a partition [i.e., wall], and on [its] elevations are men[373] who recognize all[374] by their mark. And they call out to the companions of Paradise, \"Peace be upon you.\" They have not [yet] entered it, but they long intensely.\n\n**47** (47) And when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the Fire, they say, \"Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**48** (48) And the companions of the Elevations will call to men [within Hell] whom they recognize by their mark, saying, \"Of no avail to you was your gathering[375] and [the fact] that you were arrogant.\"\n\n**49** (49) [All?h will say], \"Are these[376] the ones whom you [inhabitants of Hell] swore that All?h would never offer them mercy? Enter Paradise, [O people of the Elevations]. No fear will there be concerning you, nor will you grieve.\"\n\n**5** (5) And their declaration when Our punishment came to them was only that they said, \"Indeed, we were wrongdoers!\"\n\n**50** (50) And the companions of the Fire will call to the companions of Paradise, \"Pour upon us some water or from whatever All?h has provided you.\" They will say, \"Indeed, All?h has forbidden them both to the disbelievers\n\n**51** (51) Who took their religion as distraction and amusement and whom the worldly life deluded.\" So today We will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this Day of theirs and for having rejected Our verses.\n\n**52** (52) And We had certainly brought them a Book which We detailed by knowledge - as guidance and mercy to a people who believe.\n\n**53** (53) Do they await except its result?[377] The Day its result comes, those who had ignored it before will say, \"The messengers of our Lord had come with the truth, so are there [now] any intercessors to intercede for us or could we be sent back to do other than what we used to do?\" They will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent.\n\n**54** (54) Indeed, your Lord is All?h, who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.[378] He covers the night with the day, [another night] chasing it rapidly; and [He created] the sun, the moon, and the stars, subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**55** (55) Call upon your Lord in humility and privately; indeed, He does not like transgressors.[379]\n\n**56** (56) And cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. And invoke Him in fear and aspiration. Indeed, the mercy of All?h is near to the doers of good.\n\n**57** (57) And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy [i.e., rainfall] until, when they have carried heavy rainclouds, We drive them to a dead land and We send down rain therein and bring forth thereby [some] of all the fruits. Thus will We bring forth the dead; perhaps you may be reminded.\n\n**58** (58) And the good land - its vegetation emerges by permission of its Lord; but that which is bad - nothing emerges except sparsely, with difficulty. Thus do We diversify the signs for a people who are grateful.\n\n**59** (59) We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day.\"\n\n**6** (6) Then We will surely question those to whom [a message] was sent, and We will surely question the messengers.\n\n**60** (60) Said the eminent among his people, \"Indeed, we see you in clear error.\"\n\n**61** (61) [Noah] said, \"O my people, there is not error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**62** (62) I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you; and I know from All?h what you do not know.\n\n**63** (63) Then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that you may fear All?h so you might receive mercy?\"\n\n**64** (64) But they denied him, so We saved him and those who were with him in the ship. And We drowned those who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were a blind people.[380]\n\n**65** (65) And to the ?Aad [We sent] their brother H?d. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. Then will you not fear Him?\"\n\n**66** (66) Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, \"Indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you are of the liars.\"\n\n**67** (67) [H?d] said, \"O my people, there is not foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**68** (68) I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I am to you a trustworthy adviser.\n\n**69** (69) Then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you, that he may warn you? And remember when He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you in stature extensively. So remember the favors of All?h that you might succeed.\"\n\n**7** (7) Then We will surely relate [their deeds] to them with knowledge, and We were not [at all] absent.\n\n**70** (70) They said, \"Have you come to us that we should worship All?h alone and leave what our fathers have worshipped? Then bring us what you promise us,[381] if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**71** (71) [H?d] said, \"Already have defilement and anger fallen upon you from your Lord. Do you dispute with me concerning [mere] names you have named them,[382] you and your fathers, for which All?h has not sent down any authority? Then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.\"\n\n**72** (72) So We saved him and those with him by mercy from Us. And We eliminated those who denied Our signs, and they were not [at all] believers.\n\n**73** (73) And to the Tham?d [We sent] their brother ??li?. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. This is the she-camel of All?h [sent] to you as a sign. So leave her to eat within All?h's land and do not touch her with harm, lest there seize you a painful punishment.\n\n**74** (74) And remember when He made you successors after the ?Aad and settled you in the land, [and] you take for yourselves palaces from its plains and carve from the mountains, homes. Then remember the favors of All?h and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"\n\n**75** (75) Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed - to those who believed among them, \"Do you [actually] know that ??li? is sent from his Lord?\" They said, \"Indeed we, in that with which he was sent, are believers.\"\n\n**76** (76) Said those who were arrogant, \"Indeed we, in that which you have believed, are disbelievers.\"\n\n**77** (77) So they hamstrung the she-camel and were insolent toward the command of their Lord and said, \"O ??li?, bring us what you promise us, if you should be of the messengers.\"\n\n**78** (78) So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.\n\n**79** (79) And he [i.e., ??li?] turned away from them and said, \"O my people, I had certainly conveyed to you the message of my Lord and advised you, but you do not like advisors.\"\n\n**8** (8) And the weighing [of deeds] that Day will be the truth. So those whose scales are heavy - it is they who will be the successful.\n\n**80** (80) And [We had sent] Lot when he said to his people, \"Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds [i.e., peoples]?\n\n**81** (81) Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.\"\n\n**82** (82) But the answer of his people was only that they said, \"Evict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure.\"\n\n**83** (83) So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who remained [with the evildoers].\n\n**84** (84) And We rained upon them a rain [of stones]. Then see how was the end of the criminals.\n\n**85** (85) And to [the people of] Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu?ayb. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. So fulfill the measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due and cause not corruption upon the earth after its reformation. That is better for you, if you should be believers.\n\n**86** (86) And do not sit on every path, threatening and averting from the way of All?h those who believe in Him, seeking to make it [seem] deviant. And remember when you were few and He increased you. And see how was the end of the corrupters.\n\n**87** (87) And if there should be a group among you who has believed in that with which I have been sent and a group that has not believed, then be patient until All?h judges between us. And He is the best of judges.\"\n\n**88** (88) Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people, \"We will surely evict you, O Shu?ayb, and those who have believed with you from our city, or you must return to our religion.\" He said, \"Even if we were unwilling?\n\n**89** (89) We would have invented against All?h a lie if we returned to your religion after All?h had saved us from it. And it is not for us to return to it except that All?h, our Lord, should will. Our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge. Upon All?h we have relied. Our Lord, decide between us and our people in truth, and You are the best of those who give decision.\"\n\n**9** (9) And those whose scales are light - they are the ones who will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward Our verses.\n\n**90** (90) Said the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people, \"If you should follow Shu?ayb, indeed, you would then be losers.\"\n\n**91** (91) So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.\n\n**92** (92) Those who denied Shu?ayb - it was as though they had never resided there. Those who denied Shu?ayb - it was they who were the losers.\n\n**93** (93) And he [i.e., Shu?ayb] turned away from them and said, \"O my people, I had certainly conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and advised you, so how could I grieve for a disbelieving people?\"\n\n**94** (94) And We sent to no city a prophet [who was denied] except that We seized its people with poverty and hardship that they might humble themselves [to All?h].\n\n**95** (95) Then We exchanged in place of the bad [condition], good, until they increased [and prospered] and said, \"Our fathers [also] were touched with hardship and ease.\"[383] So We seized them suddenly while they did not perceive.[384]\n\n**96** (96) And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared All?h, We would have opened [i.e., bestowed] upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.[385]\n\n**97** (97) Then, did the people of the cities feel secure from Our punishment coming to them at night while they were asleep?\n\n**98** (98) Or did the people of the cities feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in the morning while they were at play?[386]\n\n**99** (99) Then, did they feel secure from the plan of All?h? But no one feels secure from the plan of All?h except the losing people."

    "content": "**1** (1) They ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about the bounties [of war]. Say, \"The [decision concerning] bounties is for All?h and the Messenger.\" So fear All?h and amend that which is between you and obey All?h and His Messenger, if you should be believers.\n\n**10** (10) And All?h made it not but good tidings and so that your hearts would be assured thereby. And victory is not but from All?h. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**11** (11) [Remember] when He overwhelmed you with drowsiness [giving] security from Him and sent down upon you from the sky, rain by which to purify you and remove from you the evil [suggestions] of Satan and to make steadfast your hearts and plant firmly thereby your feet.\n\n**12** (12) [Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, \"I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.\"[439]\n\n**13** (13) That is because they opposed All?h and His Messenger. And whoever opposes All?h and His Messenger - indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**14** (14) \"That [is yours], so taste it.\" And indeed for the disbelievers is the punishment of the Fire.\n\n**15** (15) O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve advancing [in battle], do not turn to them your backs [in flight].\n\n**16** (16) And whoever turns his back to them on such a day, unless swerving [as a strategy] for war or joining [another] company, has certainly returned with anger [upon him] from All?h, and his refuge is Hell - and wretched is the destination.\n\n**17** (17) And you did not kill them, but it was All?h who killed them.[440] And you threw not, [O Mu?ammad], when you threw, but it was All?h who threw[441] that He might test the believers with a good test.[442] Indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**18** (18) That [is so], and [also] that All?h will weaken the plot of the disbelievers.\n\n**19** (19) If you [disbelievers] seek the decision [i.e., victory] - the decision [i.e., defeat] has come to you. And if you desist [from hostilities], it is best for you; but if you return [to war], We will return, and never will you be availed by your [large] company at all, even if it should increase; and [that is] because All?h is with the believers.\n\n**2** (2) The believers are only those who, when All?h is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely -\n\n**20** (20) O you who have believed, obey All?h and His Messenger and do not turn from him while you hear [his order].\n\n**21** (21) And do not be like those who say, \"We have heard,\" while they do not hear.\n\n**22** (22) Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of All?h are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason [i.e., the disbelievers].\n\n**23** (23) Had All?h known any good in them, He would have made them hear. And if He had made them hear, they would [still] have turned away, while they were refusing.\n\n**24** (24) O you who have believed, respond to All?h and to the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that All?h intervenes between a man and his heart and that to Him you will be gathered.\n\n**25** (25) And fear a trial[443] which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively, and know that All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**26** (26) And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people might abduct you, but He sheltered you, supported you with His victory, and provided you with good things - that you might be grateful.\n\n**27** (27) O you who have believed, do not betray All?h and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know [the consequence].\n\n**28** (28) And know that your properties and your children are but a trial and that All?h has with Him a great reward.\n\n**29** (29) O you who have believed, if you fear All?h, He will grant you a criterion[444] and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you. And All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**3** (3) The ones who establish prayer, and from what We have provided them, they spend.\n\n**30** (30) And [remember, O Mu?ammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah]. But they plan, and All?h plans. And All?h is the best of planners.\n\n**31** (31) And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, \"We have heard. If we willed, we could say [something] like this. This is not but legends of the former peoples.\"\n\n**32** (32) And [remember] when they said, \"O All?h, if this should be the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment.\"\n\n**33** (33) But All?h would not punish them while you, [O Mu?ammad], are among them, and All?h would not punish them while they seek forgiveness.\n\n**34** (34) But why should All?h not punish them while they obstruct [people] from al-Masjid al-?ar?m and they were not [fit to be] its guardians? Its [true] guardians are not but the righteous, but most of them do not know.\n\n**35** (35) And their prayer at the House [i.e., the Ka?bah] was not except whistling and handclapping. So taste the punishment for what you disbelieved [i.e., practiced of deviations].\n\n**36** (36) Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of All?h. So they will spend it; then it will be for them a [source of] regret; then they will be overcome. And those who have disbelieved - unto Hell they will be gathered.\n\n**37** (37) [It is] so that All?h may distinguish the wicked from the good and place the wicked some of them upon others and heap them all together and put them into Hell. It is those who are the losers.\n\n**38** (38) Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them. But if they return [to hostility] - then the precedent of the former [rebellious] peoples has already taken place.[445]\n\n**39** (39) And fight against them until there is no fitnah[446] and [until] the religion [i.e., worship], all of it, is for All?h.[447] And if they cease - then indeed, All?h is Seeing of what they do.\n\n**4** (4) Those are the believers, truly. For them are degrees [of high position] with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision.\n\n**40** (40) But if they turn away - then know that All?h is your protector. Excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.\n\n**41** (41) And know that anything you obtain of war booty - then indeed, for All?h is one fifth of it and for the Messenger[448] and for [his] near relatives[449] and the orphans, the needy, and the [stranded] traveler,[450] if you have believed in All?h and in that which We sent down to Our Servant[451] on the day of criterion [i.e., decisive encounter] - the day when the two armies met [at Badr]. And All?h, over all things, is competent.\n\n**42** (42) [Remember] when you were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the farther side, and the caravan was lower [in position] than you. If you had made an appointment [to meet], you would have missed the appointment. But [it was] so that All?h might accomplish a matter already destined - that those who perished [through disbelief] would perish upon evidence and those who lived [in faith] would live upon evidence; and indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**43** (43) [Remember, O Mu?ammad], when All?h showed them to you in your dream as few; and if He had shown them to you as many, you [believers] would have lost courage and would have disputed in the matter [of whether to fight], but All?h saved [you from that]. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**44** (44) And [remember] when He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He made you [appear] as few in their eyes so that All?h might accomplish a matter already destined. And to All?h are [all] matters returned.\n\n**45** (45) O you who have believed, when you encounter a company [from the enemy forces], stand firm and remember All?h much that you may be successful.\n\n**46** (46) And obey All?h and His Messenger, and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and [then] your strength would depart; and be patient. Indeed, All?h is with the patient.\n\n**47** (47) And do not be like those who came forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert [them] from the way of All?h. And All?h is encompassing[452] of what they do.\n\n**48** (48) And [remember] when Satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said, \"No one can overcome you today from among the people, and indeed, I am your protector.\" But when the two armies sighted each other, he turned on his heels and said, \"Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I see what you do not see; indeed, I fear All?h. And All?h is severe in penalty.\"\n\n**49** (49) [Remember] when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was disease [i.e., arrogance and disbelief] said, \"Their religion has deluded those [Muslims].\" But whoever relies upon All?h - then indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**5** (5) [It[437] is] just as when your Lord brought you out of your home [for the battle of Badr] in truth, while indeed, a party among the believers were unwilling,\n\n**50** (50) And if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved...[453] They are striking their faces and their backs and [saying], \"Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.\n\n**51** (51) That is for what your hands have put forth [of evil] and because All?h is not ever unjust to [His] servants.\"\n\n**52** (52) [Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them. They disbelieved in the signs of All?h, so All?h seized them for their sins. Indeed, All?h is Powerful and severe in penalty.\n\n**53** (53) That is because All?h would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people until they change what is within themselves. And indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**54** (54) [Theirs is] like the custom of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them. They denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh. And all [of them] were wrongdoers.\n\n**55** (55) Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of All?h are those who have disbelieved, and they will not [ever] believe-\n\n**56** (56) The ones with whom you made a treaty but then they break their pledge every time, and they do not fear All?h.\n\n**57** (57) So if you, [O Mu?ammad], gain dominance over them in war, disperse by [means of] them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded.[454]\n\n**58** (58) If you [have reason to] fear from a people betrayal, throw [their treaty] back to them, [putting you] on equal terms.[455] Indeed, All?h does not like traitors.\n\n**59** (59) And let not those who disbelieve think they will escape. Indeed, they will not cause failure [to All?h].\n\n**6** (6) Arguing with you concerning the truth after it had become clear, as if they were being driven toward death while they were looking on.\n\n**60** (60) And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war[456] by which you may terrify the enemy of All?h and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know [but] whom All?h knows. And whatever you spend in the cause of All?h will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged.\n\n**61** (61) And if they incline to peace, then incline to it [also] and rely upon All?h. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**62** (62) But if they intend to deceive you - then sufficient for you is All?h. It is He who supported you with His help and with the believers\n\n**63** (63) And brought together their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have brought their hearts together; but All?h brought them together. Indeed, He is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**64** (64) O Prophet, sufficient for you is All?h and for whoever follows you of the believers.\n\n**65** (65) O Prophet, urge the believers to battle. If there are among you twenty [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are among you one hundred [who are steadfast], they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelieved because they are a people who do not understand.\n\n**66** (66) Now, All?h has lightened [the hardship] for you, and He knows that among you is weakness. So if there are from you one hundred [who are] steadfast, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are among you a thousand, they will overcome two thousand by permission of All?h. And All?h is with the steadfast.\n\n**67** (67) It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts a massacre [upon All?h's enemies] in the land. You [i.e., some Muslims] desire the commodities of this world,[457] but All?h desires [for you] the Hereafter. And All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**68** (68) If not for a decree from All?h that preceded,[458] you would have been touched for what you took by a great punishment.\n\n**69** (69) So consume what you have taken of war booty [as being] lawful and good, and fear All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**7** (7) [Remember, O believers], when All?h promised you one of the two groups[438] - that it would be yours - and you wished that the unarmed one would be yours. But All?h intended to establish the truth by His words and to eliminate the disbelievers\n\n**70** (70) O Prophet, say to whoever is in your hands of the captives, \"If All?h knows [any] good in your hearts, He will give you [something] better than what was taken from you, and He will forgive you; and All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**71** (71) But if they intend to betray you - then they have already betrayed All?h before, and He empowered [you] over them. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**72** (72) Indeed, those who have believed and emigrated and fought with their wealth and lives in the cause of All?h and those who gave shelter and aided - they are allies of one another. But those who believed and did not emigrate - for you there is no support of them until they emigrate. And if they seek help of you for the religion, then you must help, except against a people between yourselves and whom is a treaty. And All?h is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**73** (73) And those who disbelieved are allies of one another. If you do not do so [i.e., ally yourselves with other believers], there will be fitnah [i.e., disbelief and oppression] on earth and great corruption.\n\n**74** (74) But those who have believed and emigrated and fought in the cause of All?h and those who gave shelter and aided - it is they who are the believers, truly. For them is forgiveness and noble provision.\n\n**75** (75) And those who believed after [the initial emigration] and emigrated and fought with you - they are of you. But those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of All?h.[459] Indeed, All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**8** (8) That He should establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even if the criminals disliked it.\n\n**9** (9) [Remember] when you were asking help of your Lord, and He answered you, \"Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand from the angels, following one another.\""

    "slug": "/surahs/surah-009",
    "content": "**1** (1) [This is a declaration of] disassociation, from All?h and His Messenger, to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists.[461]\n\n**10** (10) They do not observe toward a believer any pact of kinship or covenant of protection. And it is they who are the transgressors.\n\n**100** (100) And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muh?jireen[500] and the An??r[501] and those who followed them with good conduct - All?h is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.\n\n**101** (101) And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, and [also] from the people of Mad?nah. They have persisted in hypocrisy. You, [O Mu?ammad], do not know them, [but] We know them. We will punish them twice [in this world]; then they will be returned to a great punishment.\n\n**102** (102) And [there are] others who have acknowledged their sins. They had mixed [i.e., polluted] a righteous deed with another that was bad.[502] Perhaps All?h will turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**103** (103) Take, [O Mu?ammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [All?h's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**104** (104) Do they not know that it is All?h who accepts repentance from His servants and receives charities and that it is All?h who is the Accepting of Repentance,[503] the Merciful?\n\n**105** (105) And say, \"Do [as you will], for All?h will see your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.\"\n\n**106** (106) And [there are] others deferred until the command of All?h - whether He will punish them or whether He will forgive them. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**107** (107) And [there are] those [hypocrites] who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against All?h and His Messenger before. And they will surely swear, \"We intended only the best.\" And All?h testifies that indeed they are liars.\n\n**108** (108) Do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day[504] is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and All?h loves those who purify themselves.\n\n**109** (109) Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness [with fear] from All?h and [seeking] His approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell? And All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n\n**11** (11) But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, then they are your brothers in religion; and We detail the verses for a people who know.\n\n**110** (110) Their building which they built will not cease to be a [cause of] skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut [i.e., stopped]. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**111** (111) Indeed, All?h has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties [in exchange] for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of All?h, so they kill and are killed. [It is] a true promise [binding] upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur�?n. And who is truer to his covenant than All?h? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted. And it is that which is the great attainment.\n\n**112** (112) [Such believers are] the repentant, the worshippers, the praisers [of All?h], the travelers [for His cause], those who bow and prostrate [in prayer], those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and those who observe the limits [set by] All?h. And give good tidings to the believers.\n\n**113** (113) It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire.\n\n**114** (114) And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to him [i.e., Abraham] that he [i.e., the father] was an enemy to All?h, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient.\n\n**115** (115) And All?h would not let a people stray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should avoid. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**116** (116) Indeed, to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes death. And you have not besides All?h any protector or any helper.\n\n**117** (117) All?h has already forgiven the Prophet and the Muh?jireen and the An??r who followed him in the hour of difficulty after the hearts of a party of them had almost inclined [to doubt], and then He forgave them. Indeed, He was to them Kind and Merciful.\n\n**118** (118) And [He also forgave] the three who were left alone [i.e., boycotted, regretting their error] to the point that the earth closed in on them in spite of its vastness[505] and their souls confined [i.e., anguished] them and they were certain that there is no refuge from All?h except in Him. Then He turned to them so they could repent. Indeed, All?h is the Accepting of Repentance,[506] the Merciful.\n\n**119** (119) O you who have believed, fear All?h and be with those who are true.\n\n**12** (12) And if they break their oaths after their treaty and defame your religion, then combat the leaders of disbelief, for indeed, there are no oaths [sacred] to them; [fight them that] they might cease.\n\n**120** (120) It was not [proper] for the people of Mad?nah and those surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind after [the departure of] the Messenger of All?h or that they prefer themselves over his self.[507] That is because they are not afflicted by thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of All?h, nor do they tread on any ground that enrages the disbelievers, nor do they inflict upon an enemy any infliction but that it is registered for them as a righteous deed. Indeed, All?h does not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good.\n\n**121** (121) Nor do they spend an expenditure, small or large, or cross a valley but that it is registered for them that All?h may reward them for the best of what they were doing.\n\n**122** (122) And it is not for the believers to go forth [to battle] all at once. For there should separate from every division of them a group [remaining] to obtain understanding in the religion and warn [i.e., advise] their people when they return to them that they might be cautious.\n\n**123** (123) O you who have believed, fight against those adjacent to you of the disbelievers and let them find in you harshness. And know that All?h is with the righteous.\n\n**124** (124) And whenever a s?rah is revealed, there are among them [i.e., the hypocrites] those who say, \"Which of you has this increased in faith?\" As for those who believed, it has increased them in faith, while they are rejoicing.\n\n**125** (125) But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it has [only] increased them in evil [in addition] to their evil.[508] And they will have died while they are disbelievers.\n\n**126** (126) Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice but then they do not repent nor do they remember?\n\n**127** (127) And whenever a s?rah is revealed, they look at each other, [as if saying], \"Does anyone see you?\" and then they dismiss themselves. All?h has dismissed their hearts because they are a people who do not understand.\n\n**128** (128) There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you [i.e., your guidance] and to the believers is kind and merciful.\n\n**129** (129) But if they turn away, [O Mu?ammad], say, \"Sufficient for me is All?h; there is no deity except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.\"\n\n**13** (13) Would you not fight against a people who broke their oaths and determined to expel the Messenger, and they had begun [the attack upon] you the first time? Do you fear them? But All?h has more right that you should fear Him, if you are [truly] believers.\n\n**14** (14) Fight them; All?h will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts [i.e., desires] of a believing people\n\n**15** (15) And remove the fury in their [i.e., the believers'] hearts. And All?h turns in forgiveness to whom He wills; and All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**16** (16) Do you think that you will be left [as you are] while All?h has not yet made evident those among you who strive [for His cause] and do not take other than All?h, His Messenger and the believers as intimates? And All?h is [fully] Aware of what you do.\n\n**17** (17) It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of All?h [while] witnessing against themselves with disbelief. [For] those, their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire they will abide eternally.\n\n**18** (18) The mosques of All?h are only to be maintained by those who believe in All?h and the Last Day and establish prayer and give zak?h and do not fear except All?h, for it is expected that those will be of the [rightly] guided.\n\n**19** (19) Have you made the providing of water for the pilgrim and the maintenance of al-Masjid al-?ar?m equal to [the deeds of] one who believes in All?h and the Last Day and strives in the cause of All?h? They are not equal in the sight of All?h. And All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n\n**2** (2) So travel freely, [O disbelievers], throughout the land [during] four months but know that you cannot cause failure to All?h and that All?h will disgrace the disbelievers.\n\n**20** (20) The ones who have believed, emigrated and striven in the cause of All?h with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of All?h. And it is those who are the attainers [of success].\n\n**21** (21) Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and approval and of gardens for them wherein is enduring pleasure.\n\n**22** (22) [They will be] abiding therein forever. Indeed, All?h has with Him a great reward.\n\n**23** (23) O you who have believed, do not take your fathers or your brothers as allies if they have preferred disbelief over belief. And whoever does so among you - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.\n\n**24** (24) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than All?h and His Messenger and jih?d [i.e., striving] in His cause, then wait until All?h executes His command. And All?h does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.\"\n\n**25** (25) All?h has already given you victory in many regions and [even] on the day of ?unayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth was confining for you with [i.e., in spite of] its vastness; then you turned back, fleeing.\n\n**26** (26) Then All?h sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and sent down soldiers [i.e., angels] whom you did not see and punished those who disbelieved. And that is the recompense of the disbelievers.\n\n**27** (27) Then All?h will accept repentance after that for whom He wills; and All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**28** (28) O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-?ar?m after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, All?h will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**29** (29) Fight against those who do not believe in All?h or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what All?h and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth [i.e., Isl?m] from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah[466] willingly while they are humbled.\n\n**3** (3) And [it is] an announcement from All?h and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage[462] that All?h is disassociated from the disbelievers, and [so is] His Messenger. So if you repent, that is best for you; but if you turn away - then know that you will not cause failure to All?h.[463] And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment.\n\n**30** (30) The Jews say, \"Ezra is the son of All?h\"; and the Christians say, \"The Messiah is the son of All?h.\" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before [them]. May All?h destroy them; how are they deluded?\n\n**31** (31) They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides All?h,[467] and [also] the Messiah, the son of Mary.[468] And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him.\n\n**32** (32) They want to extinguish the light of All?h with their mouths, but All?h refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.\n\n**33** (33) It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although they who associate others with All?h dislike it.\n\n**34** (34) O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly[469] and avert [them] from the way of All?h. And those who hoard gold and silver and spend it not in the way of All?h - give them tidings of a painful punishment.\n\n**35** (35) The Day when it[470] will be heated in the fire of Hell and seared therewith will be their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, [it will be said], \"This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you used to hoard.\"\n\n**36** (36) Indeed, the number of months with All?h is twelve [lunar] months in the register of All?h [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred.[471] That is the correct religion [i.e., way], so do not wrong yourselves during them.[472] And fight against the disbelievers collectively as they fight against you collectively. And know that All?h is with the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n**37** (37) Indeed, the postponing [of restriction within sacred months] is an increase in disbelief by which those who have disbelieved are led [further] astray. They make it[473] lawful one year and unlawful another year to correspond to the number made unlawful by All?h[474] and [thus] make lawful what All?h has made unlawful. Made pleasing to them is the evil of their deeds; and All?h does not guide the disbelieving people.\n\n**38** (38) O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when you are told to go forth in the cause of All?h, you adhere heavily to the earth?[475] Are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of worldly life compared to the Hereafter except a [very] little.\n\n**39** (39) If you do not go forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with another people, and you will not harm Him at all. And All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**4** (4) Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything or supported anyone against you; so complete for them their treaty until their term [has ended]. Indeed, All?h loves the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n**40** (40) If you do not aid him [i.e., the Prophet (?)] - All?h has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two,[476] when they were in the cave and he [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] said to his companion, \"Do not grieve; indeed All?h is with us.\" And All?h sent down His tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers [i.e., angels] you did not see and made the word[477] of those who disbelieved the lowest,[478] while the word of All?h[479] - that is the highest. And All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**41** (41) Go forth, whether light or heavy,[480] and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of All?h. That is better for you, if you only knew.\n\n**42** (42) Had it been a near [i.e., easy] gain and a moderate trip, they [i.e., the hypocrites] would have followed you, but distant to them was the journey. And they will swear by All?h,[481] \"If we were able, we would have gone forth with you,\" destroying themselves [through false oaths], and All?h knows that indeed they are liars.\n\n**43** (43) All?h has pardoned you, [O Mu?ammad, but] why did you give them permission [to remain behind]? [You should not have] until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew [who were] the liars.\n\n**44** (44) Those who believe in All?h and the Last Day would not ask permission of you to be excused from striving [i.e., fighting] with their wealth and their lives. And All?h is Knowing of those who fear Him.\n\n**45** (45) Only those would ask permission of you who do not believe in All?h and the Last Day and whose hearts have doubted, and they, in their doubt, are hesitating.\n\n**46** (46) And if they had intended to go forth, they would have prepared for it [some] preparation. But All?h disliked their being sent, so He kept them back, and they were told, \"Remain [behind] with those who remain.\"[482]\n\n**47** (47) Had they gone forth with you, they would not have increased you except in confusion, and they would have been active among you, seeking [to cause] you fitnah [i.e., chaos and dissension]. And among you are avid listeners to them. And All?h is Knowing of the wrongdoers.\n\n**48** (48) They had already desired dissension before and had upset matters for you[483] until the truth came and the ordinance [i.e., victory] of All?h appeared, while they were averse.\n\n**49** (49) And among them is he who says, \"Permit me [to remain at home] and do not put me to trial.\" Unquestionably, into trial they have fallen.[484] And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers.\n\n**5** (5) And when the inviolable months[464] have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and sit in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they should repent, establish prayer, and give zak?h, let them [go] on their way. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**50** (50) If good befalls you, it distresses them; but if disaster strikes you, they say, \"We took our matter [in hand] before,\"[485] and turn away while they are rejoicing.\n\n**51** (51) Say, \"Never will we be struck except by what All?h has decreed for us; He is our protector.\" And upon All?h let the believers rely.\n\n**52** (52) Say, \"Do you await for us except one of the two best things [i.e., martyrdom or victory] while we await for you that All?h will afflict you with punishment from Himself or at our hands? So wait; indeed we, along with you, are waiting.\"\n\n**53** (53) Say, \"Spend willingly or unwillingly; never will it be accepted from you. Indeed, you have been a defiantly disobedient people.\"\n\n**54** (54) And what prevents their expenditures from being accepted from them but that they have disbelieved in All?h and in His Messenger and that they come not to prayer except while they are lazy and that they do not spend except while they are unwilling.\n\n**55** (55) So let not their wealth or their children impress you. All?h only intends to punish them through them in worldly life and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.\n\n**56** (56) And they swear by All?h that they are from among you while they are not from among you; but they are a people who are afraid.\n\n**57** (57) If they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter [and hide], they would turn to it while they run heedlessly.\n\n**58** (58) And among them are some who criticize you concerning the [distribution of] charities. If they are given from them, they approve; but if they are not given from them, at once they become angry.\n\n**59** (59) If only they had been satisfied with what All?h and His Messenger gave them and said, \"Sufficient for us is All?h; All?h will give us of His bounty, and [so will] His Messenger; indeed, we are desirous toward All?h,\"[486] [it would have been better for them].\n\n**6** (6) And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of All?h [i.e., the Qur�?n]. Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.\n\n**60** (60) Zak?h expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed for it[487] and for bringing hearts together [for Isl?m] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of All?h and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by All?h. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**61** (61) And among them are those who abuse the Prophet and say, \"He is an ear.\"[488] Say, \"[It is] an ear of goodness for you that believes in All?h and believes the believers and [is] a mercy to those who believe among you.\" And those who abuse the Messenger of All?h - for them is a painful punishment.\n\n**62** (62) They swear by All?h to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But All?h and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy,[489] if they were to be believers.\n\n**63** (63) Do they not know that whoever opposes All?h and His Messenger - that for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will abide eternally? That is the great disgrace.\n\n**64** (64) The hypocrites are apprehensive lest a s?rah be revealed about them, informing them of[490] what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock [as you wish]; indeed, All?h will expose that which you fear.\"\n\n**65** (65) And if you ask them, they will surely say, \"We were only conversing and playing.\" Say, \"Is it All?h and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?\"\n\n**66** (66) Make no excuse; you have disbelieved [i.e., rejected faith] after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you - We will punish another faction because they were criminals.\n\n**67** (67) The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands.[491] They have forgotten All?h, so He has forgotten them [accordingly]. Indeed, the hypocrites - it is they who are the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**68** (68) All?h has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. It is sufficient for them. And All?h has cursed them, and for them is an enduring punishment.\n\n**69** (69) [You disbelievers are] like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion [of worldly enjoyment], and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion, and you have engaged [in vanities] like that in which they engaged. [It is] those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers.\n\n**7** (7) How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of All?h and with His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-?ar?m? So as long as they are upright toward you,[465] be upright toward them. Indeed, All?h loves the righteous [who fear Him].\n\n**70** (70) Has there not reached them the news of those before them - the people of Noah and [the tribes of] ?Aad and Tham?d and the people of Abraham and the companions [i.e., dwellers] of Madyan and the towns overturned?[492] Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. And All?h would never have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves.\n\n**71** (71) The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zak?h and obey All?h and His Messenger. Those - All?h will have mercy upon them. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**72** (72) All?h has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence; but approval from All?h is greater. It is that which is the great attainment.\n\n**73** (73) O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.\n\n**74** (74) They swear by All?h that they did not say [anything against the Prophet (?)] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their [pretense of] Isl?m and planned that which they were not to attain.[493] And they were not resentful except [for the fact] that All?h and His Messenger had enriched them of His bounty.[494] So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, All?h will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper.\n\n**75** (75) And among them are those who made a covenant with All?h, [saying], \"If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous.\"\n\n**76** (76) But when He gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused.\n\n**77** (77) So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day they will meet Him - because they failed All?h in what they promised Him and because they [habitually] used to lie.\n\n**78** (78) Did they not know that All?h knows their secrets and their private conversations and that All?h is the Knower of the unseen?\n\n**79** (79) Those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning [their] charities and [criticize] the ones who find nothing [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicule them - All?h will ridicule them, and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**8** (8) How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse [compliance], and most of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**80** (80) Ask forgiveness for them, [O Mu?ammad], or do not ask forgiveness for them. If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times - never will All?h forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in All?h and His Messenger, and All?h does not guide the defiantly disobedient people.\n\n**81** (81) Those who remained behind[495] rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of All?h and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of All?h and said, \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intense in heat\" - if they would but understand.\n\n**82** (82) So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn.\n\n**83** (83) If All?h should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to battle], say, \"You will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy. Indeed, you were satisfied with sitting [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those who stay behind.\"\n\n**84** (84) And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Mu?ammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in All?h and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.\n\n**85** (85) And let not their wealth and their children impress you. All?h only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.\n\n**86** (86) And when a s?rah was revealed [enjoining them] to believe in All?h and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, \"Leave us to be with them who sit [at home].\"\n\n**87** (87) They were satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts were sealed over, so they do not understand.\n\n**88** (88) But the Messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives. Those will have [all that is] good and it is those who are the successful.\n\n**89** (89) All?h has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the great attainment.\n\n**9** (9) They have exchanged the signs of All?h for a small price and averted [people] from His way. Indeed, it was evil that they were doing.\n\n**90** (90) And those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted [to remain], and they who had lied[496] to All?h and His Messenger sat [at home]. There will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.\n\n**91** (91) There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort [i.e., guilt] when they are sincere to All?h and His Messenger. There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]. And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**92** (92) Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you for you to take them along, you said, \"I can find nothing upon which to carry you.\"[497] They turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend [for the cause of All?h].\n\n**93** (93) The cause [for blame] is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich. They are satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and All?h has sealed over their hearts, so they do not know.\n\n**94** (94) They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them. Say, \"Make no excuse - never will we believe you. All?h has already informed us of your news [i.e., affair]. And All?h will observe your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger; then you will be taken back to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed,[498] and He will inform you of what you used to do.\"\n\n**95** (95) They will swear by All?h to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone. So leave them alone; indeed they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they had been earning.\n\n**96** (96) They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them. But if you should be satisfied with them - indeed, All?h is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people.\n\n**97** (97) The bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what [laws] All?h has revealed to His Messenger. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**98** (98) And among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss[499] and await for you turns of misfortune. Upon them will be a misfortune of evil. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**99** (99) But among the bedouins are some who believe in All?h and the Last Day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to All?h and of [obtaining] invocations of the Messenger. Unquestionably, it is a means of nearness for them. All?h will admit them to His mercy. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful."

    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, R?.[510] These are the verses of the wise[511] Book.\n\n**10** (10) Their call therein will be, \"Exalted are You, O All?h,\" and their greeting therein will be, \"Peace.\" And the last of their call will be, \"Praise to All?h, Lord of the worlds!\"\n\n**100** (100) And it is not for a soul [i.e., anyone] to believe except by permission of All?h, and He will place defilement[541] upon those who will not use reason.\n\n**101** (101) Say, \"Observe what is in the heavens and the earth.\" But of no avail will be signs or warners to a people who do not believe.\n\n**102** (102) So do they wait except for like [what occurred in] the days of those who passed on before them? Say, \"Then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.\"\n\n**103** (103) Then We will save Our messengers and those who have believed. Thus, it is an obligation upon Us that We save the believers.[542]\n\n**104** (104) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion - then I do not worship those which you worship besides All?h; but I worship All?h, who causes your death. And I have been commanded to be of the believers\n\n**105** (105) And [commanded], 'Direct your face [i.e., self] toward the religion, inclining to truth, and never be of those who associate others with All?h;\n\n**106** (106) And do not invoke[543] besides All?h that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.'\"[544]\n\n**107** (107) And if All?h should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him; and if He intends for you good, then there is no repeller of His bounty. He causes it to reach whom He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\n**108** (108) Say, \"O mankind, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul, and whoever goes astray only goes astray [in violation] against it. And I am not over you a manager.\"\n\n**109** (109) And follow what is revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and be patient until All?h will judge. And He is the best of judges.\n\n**11** (11) And if All?h was to hasten for the people the evil [they invoke][514] as He hastens for them the good, their term would have been ended for them.[515] But We leave the ones who do not expect the meeting with Us, in their transgression, wandering blindly.\n\n**12** (12) And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he had never called upon Us to [remove] an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing.\n\n**13** (13) And We had already destroyed generations before you when they wronged, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe. Thus do We recompense the criminal people.\n\n**14** (14) Then We made you successors in the land after them so that We may observe how you will do.\n\n**15** (15) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, \"Bring us a Qur�?n other than this or change it.\" Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"It is not for me to change it on my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.\"\n\n**16** (16) Say, \"If All?h had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you, for I had remained among you a lifetime before it.[516] Then will you not reason?\"\n\n**17** (17) So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about All?h or denies His signs? Indeed, the criminals will not succeed.\n\n**18** (18) And they worship other than All?h that which neither harms them nor benefits them, and they say, \"These are our intercessors with All?h.\" Say, \"Do you inform All?h of something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?\" Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\n\n**19** (19) And mankind was not but one community [united in religion], but [then] they differed. And if not for a word[517] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them [immediately] concerning that over which they differ.\n\n**2** (2) Have the people been amazed that We revealed [revelation] to a man from among them, [saying], \"Warn mankind and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a [firm] precedence of honor[512] with their Lord\"? [But] the disbelievers say, \"Indeed, this is an obvious magician.\"\n\n**20** (20) And they say, \"Why is a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?\" So say, \"The unseen is only for All?h [to administer], so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.\"\n\n**21** (21) And when We give the people a taste of mercy after adversity has touched them, at once they conspire against Our verses. Say, \"All?h is swifter in strategy.\" Indeed, Our messengers [i.e., angels] record that which you conspire.\n\n**22** (22) It is He who enables you to travel on land and sea until, when you are in ships and they sail with them[518] by a good wind and they rejoice therein, there comes a storm wind and the waves come upon them from every place and they expect to be engulfed, they supplicate All?h, sincere to Him in religion, \"If You should save us from this, we will surely be among the thankful.\"\n\n**23** (23) But when He saves them, at once they commit injustice[519] upon the earth without right. O mankind, your injustice is only against yourselves, [being merely] the enjoyment of worldly life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you of what you used to do.\n\n**24** (24) The example of [this] worldly life is but like rain which We have sent down from the sky that the plants of the earth absorb - [those] from which men and livestock eat - until, when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people suppose that they have capability over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest,[520] as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We explain in detail the signs for a people who give thought.\n\n**25** (25) And All?h invites to the Home of Peace [i.e., Paradise] and guides whom He wills to a straight path.\n\n**26** (26) For them who have done good is the best [reward] - and extra.[521] No darkness will cover their faces, nor humiliation. Those are companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**27** (27) But they who have earned [blame for] evil doings - the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliation will cover them. They will have from All?h no protector. It will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark [are they]. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**28** (28) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], the Day We will gather them all together - then We will say to those who associated others with All?h, \"[Remain in] your place, you and your 'partners.'\"[522] Then We will separate them,[523] and their \"partners\" will say, \"You did not used to worship us,[524]\n\n**29** (29) And sufficient is All?h as a witness between us and you that we were of your worship unaware.\"\n\n**3** (3) Indeed, your Lord is All?h, who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne,[513] arranging the matter [of His creation]. There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is All?h, your Lord, so worship Him. Then will you not remember?\n\n**30** (30) There, [on that Day], every soul will be put to trial for what it did previously, and they will be returned to All?h, their master, the Truth, and lost from them is whatever they used to invent.\n\n**31** (31) Say, \"Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?\" They will say, \"All?h,\" so say, \"Then will you not fear Him?\"\n\n**32** (32) For that is All?h, your Lord, the Truth. And what can be beyond truth except error? So how are you averted?\n\n**33** (33) Thus the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord has come into effect upon those who defiantly disobeyed - that they will not believe.\n\n**34** (34) Say, \"Are there of your 'partners' any who begins creation and then repeats it?\" Say, \"All?h begins creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?\"\n\n**35** (35) Say, \"Are there of your 'partners' any who guides to the truth?\" Say, \"All?h guides to the truth. So is He who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed or he who guides not unless he is guided? Then what is [wrong] with you - how do you judge?\"\n\n**36** (36) And most of them follow not except assumption. Indeed, assumption avails not against the truth at all. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of what they do.\n\n**37** (37) And it was not [possible] for this Qur�?n to be produced by other than All?h, but [it is] a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about which there is no doubt,[525] from the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**38** (38) Or do they say [about the Prophet (?)], \"He invented it?\" Say, \"Then bring forth a s?rah like it and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides All?h, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**39** (39) Rather, they have denied that which they encompass not in knowledge and whose interpretation has not yet come to them. Thus did those before them deny. Then observe how was the end of the wrongdoers.\n\n**4** (4) To Him is your return all together. [It is] the promise of All?h [which is] truth. Indeed, He begins the [process of] creation and then repeats it that He may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds, in justice. But those who disbelieved will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to deny.\n\n**40** (40) And of them are those who believe in it, and of them are those who do not believe in it. And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters.\n\n**41** (41) And if they deny you, [O Mu?ammad], then say, \"For me are my deeds, and for you are your deeds. You are disassociated from what I do, and I am disassociated from what you do.\"\n\n**42** (42) And among them are those who listen to you. But can you cause the deaf to hear [i.e., benefit from this hearing], although they will not use reason?\n\n**43** (43) And among them are those who look at you. But can you guide the blind although they will not [attempt to] see?\n\n**44** (44) Indeed, All?h does not wrong the people at all, but it is the people who are wronging themselves.\n\n**45** (45) And on the Day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if they had not remained [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and] they will know each other. Those will have lost who denied the meeting with All?h and were not guided.\n\n**46** (46) And whether We show you some of what We promise them, [O Mu?ammad], or We take you in death, to Us is their return; then, [either way], All?h is a witness concerning what they are doing.\n\n**47** (47) And for every nation is a messenger. So when their messenger comes,[526] it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**48** (48) And they say, \"When is [the fulfillment of] this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**49** (49) Say, \"I possess not for myself any harm or benefit except what All?h should will. For every nation is a [specified] term. When their time has come, then they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].\"\n\n**5** (5) It is He who made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases - that you may know the number of years and account [of time]. All?h has not created this except in truth. He details the signs for a people who know.\n\n**50** (50) Say, \"Have you considered: if His punishment should come to you by night or by day - for which [aspect] of it would the criminals be impatient?\"[527]\n\n**51** (51) Then is it that when it has [actually] occurred you will believe in it? Now?[528] And you were [once] for it impatient.[529]\n\n**52** (52) Then it will be said to those who had wronged, \"Taste the punishment of eternity; are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?\"\n\n**53** (53) And they ask information of you, [O Mu?ammad], \"Is it true?\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord. Indeed, it is truth; and you will not cause failure [to All?h].\"\n\n**54** (54) And if each soul that wronged had everything on earth, it would offer it in ransom. And they will confide regret when they see the punishment; and they will be judged in justice, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**55** (55) Unquestionably, to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Unquestionably, the promise of All?h is truth, but most of them do not know.\n\n**56** (56) He gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**57** (57) O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers.\n\n**58** (58) Say, \"In the bounty of All?h and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate.\"\n\n**59** (59) Say, \"Have you seen what All?h has sent down to you of provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful?\" Say, \"Has All?h permitted you [to do so], or do you invent [something] about All?h?\"\n\n**6** (6) Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and [in] what All?h has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear All?h.\n\n**60** (60) And what will be the supposition of those who invent falsehood about All?h on the Day of Resurrection?[530] Indeed, All?h is the possessor of bounty for the people, but most of them are not grateful.\n\n**61** (61) And, [O Mu?ammad], you are not [engaged] in any matter and do not recite any of the Qur�?n and you [people] do not do any deed except that We are witness over you when you are involved in it. And not absent from your Lord is any [part] of an atom's weight[531] within the earth or within the heaven or [anything] smaller than that or greater but that it is in a clear register.\n\n**62** (62) Unquestionably, [for] the allies of All?h there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve -\n\n**63** (63) Those who believed and were fearing All?h.\n\n**64** (64) For them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. No change is there in the words [i.e., decrees] of All?h. That is what is the great attainment.\n\n**65** (65) And let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, honor [due to power] belongs to All?h entirely. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**66** (66) Unquestionably, to All?h belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth. And those who invoke other than All?h do not [actually] follow [His] \"partners.\" They follow not except assumption, and they are not but misjudging.\n\n**67** (67) It is He who made for you the night to rest therein and the day, giving sight.[532] Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen.\n\n**68** (68) They[533] have said, \"All?h has taken a son.\" Exalted is He; He is the [one] Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority[534] for this [claim]. Do you say about All?h that which you do not know?\n\n**69** (69) Say, \"Indeed, those who invent falsehood about All?h will not succeed.\"\n\n**7** (7) Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure therein and those who are heedless of Our signs -\n\n**70** (70) [For them is brief] enjoyment in this world; then to Us is their return; then We will make them taste the severe punishment because they used to disbelieve.\n\n**71** (71) And recite to them the news of Noah, when he said to his people, \"O my people, if my residence and my reminding of the signs of All?h has become burdensome upon you - then I have relied upon All?h. So resolve upon your plan and [call upon] your associates. Then let not your plan be obscure to you.[535] Then carry it out upon me and do not give me respite.\n\n**72** (72) And if you turn away [from my advice] - then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from All?h, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims [i.e., those who submit to All?h].\"\n\n**73** (73) And they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Then see how was the end of those who were warned.\n\n**74** (74) Then We sent after him messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear proofs. But they were not to believe in that which they had denied before.[536] Thus We seal over the hearts of the transgressors.\n\n**75** (75) Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his establishment with Our signs, but they behaved arrogantly and were a criminal people.\n\n**76** (76) So when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, \"Indeed, this is obvious magic.\"\n\n**77** (77) Moses said, \"Do you say [thus] about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? But magicians will not succeed.\"\n\n**78** (78) They said, \"Have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? And we are not believers in you.\"\n\n**79** (79) And Pharaoh said, \"Bring to me every learned magician.\"\n\n**8** (8) For those their refuge will be the Fire because of what they used to earn.\n\n**80** (80) So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, \"Throw down whatever you will throw.\"\n\n**81** (81) And when they had thrown, Moses said, \"What you have brought is [only] magic. Indeed, All?h will expose its worthlessness. Indeed, All?h does not amend the work of corrupters.\n\n**82** (82) And All?h will establish the truth by His words, even if the criminals dislike it.\"\n\n**83** (83) But no one believed Moses, except [some] offspring [i.e., youths] among his people, for fear of Pharaoh and his establishment that they would persecute them. And indeed, Pharaoh was haughty within the land, and indeed, he was of the transgressors.\n\n**84** (84) And Moses said, \"O my people, if you have believed in All?h, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims [i.e., submitting to Him].\"\n\n**85** (85) So they said, \"Upon All?h do we rely. Our Lord, make us not [objects of] trial for the wrongdoing people\n\n**86** (86) And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.\"\n\n**87** (87) And We inspired to Moses and his brother, \"Settle your people in Egypt in houses and make your houses [facing the] qiblah[537] and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers.\"\n\n**88** (88) And Moses said, \"Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life, our Lord, that they may lead [men] astray from Your way. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.\"\n\n**89** (89) [All?h] said, \"Your supplication has been answered.\"[538] So remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know.\"\n\n**9** (9) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Beneath them rivers will flow in the Gardens of Pleasure.\n\n**90** (90) And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, \"I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.\"\n\n**91** (91) Now? And you had disobeyed [Him] before and were of the corrupters?\n\n**92** (92) So today We will save you in body[539] that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed, many among the people, of Our signs, are heedless.\n\n**93** (93) And We had certainly settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after] knowledge had come to them. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\n\n**94** (94) So if you are in doubt, [O Mu?ammad], about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters.\n\n**95** (95) And never be of those who deny the signs of All?h and [thus] be among the losers.[540]\n\n**96** (96) Indeed, those upon whom the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord has come into effect will not believe,\n\n**97** (97) Even if every sign should come to them, until they see the painful punishment.\n\n**98** (98) Then has there not been a [single] city that believed so its faith benefited it except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in worldly life and gave them enjoyment [i.e., provision] for a time.\n\n**99** (99) And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed - all of them entirely. Then, [O Mu?ammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?"

    "slug": "/surahs/surah-011",
    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, R?.[546] [This is] a Book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from [one who is] Wise and Aware[547]\n\n**10** (10) But if We give him a taste of favor after hardship has touched him, he will surely say, \"Bad times have left me.\" Indeed, he is exultant and boastful -\n\n**100** (100) That is from the news of the cities, which We relate to you; of them, some are [still] standing and some are [as] a harvest [mowed down].[577]\n\n**101** (101) And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. And they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than All?h when there came the command of your Lord. And they did not increase them in other than ruin.\n\n**102** (102) And thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the cities while they are committing wrong. Indeed, His seizure is painful and severe.\n\n**103** (103) Indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which the people will be collected, and that is a Day [which will be] witnessed.\n\n**104** (104) And We do not delay it except for a limited term.\n\n**105** (105) The Day it comes no soul will speak except by His permission. And among them will be the wretched and the prosperous.\n\n**106** (106) As for those who were [destined to be] wretched, they will be in the Fire. For them therein is [violent] exhaling and inhaling.[578]\n\n**107** (107) [They will be] abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord should will. Indeed, your Lord is an effecter of what He intends.\n\n**108** (108) And as for those who were [destined to be] prosperous, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord should will - a bestowal uninterrupted.\n\n**109** (109) So do not be in doubt, [O Mu?ammad], as to what these [polytheists] are worshipping. They worship not except as their fathers worshipped before. And indeed, We will give them their share undiminished.\n\n**11** (11) Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds; those will have forgiveness and great reward.\n\n**110** (110) And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement. And if not for a word[579] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the Qur�?n], in disquieting doubt.\n\n**111** (111) And indeed, each [of the believers and disbelievers] - your Lord will fully compensate them for their deeds. Indeed, He is Aware of what they do.\n\n**112** (112) So remain on a right course as you have been commanded, [you] and those who have turned back with you [to All?h], and do not transgress. Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**113** (113) And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest you be touched by the Fire, and you would not have other than All?h any protectors; then you would not be helped.\n\n**114** (114) And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember.\n\n**115** (115) And be patient, for indeed, All?h does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\n\n**116** (116) So why were there not[580] among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth - except a few of those We saved from among them? But those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein, and they were criminals.\n\n**117** (117) And your Lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers.\n\n**118** (118) And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ,\n\n**119** (119) Except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He created them. But the word of your Lord is to be fulfilled that, \"I will surely fill Hell with jinn and men all together.\"\n\n**12** (12) Then would you possibly leave [out] some of what is revealed to you,[550] or is your breast constrained by it because they say, \"Why has there not been sent down to him a treasure or come with him an angel?\" But you are only a warner. And All?h is Disposer of all things.\n\n**120** (120) And each [story] We relate to you from the news of the messengers is that by which We make firm your heart. And there has come to you, in this, the truth and an instruction and a reminder for the believers.\n\n**121** (121) And say to those who do not believe, \"Work according to your position; indeed, we are working.\n\n**122** (122) And wait; indeed, we are waiting.\"\n\n**123** (123) And to All?h belong the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and to Him will be returned the matter, all of it, so worship Him and rely upon Him. And your Lord is not unaware of that which you do.\n\n**13** (13) Or do they say, \"He invented it\"? Say, \"Then bring ten s?rahs like it that have been invented and call upon [for assistance] whomever you can besides All?h, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**14** (14) And if they do not respond to you - then know that it [i.e., the Qur�?n] was revealed with the knowledge of All?h[551] and that there is no deity except Him. Then,[552] would you [not] be Muslims?\n\n**15** (15) Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein,[553] and they therein will not be deprived.\n\n**16** (16) Those are the ones for whom there is not in the Hereafter but the Fire. And lost is what they did therein,[554] and worthless is what they used to do.\n\n**17** (17) So is one who [stands] upon a clear evidence from his Lord [like the aforementioned]? And a witness[555] from Him follows it,[556] and before it was the Scripture of Moses to lead and as mercy. Those [believers in the former revelations] believe in it [i.e., the Qur�?n]. But whoever disbelieves in it from the [various] factions - the Fire is his promised destination. So be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.\n\n**18** (18) And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about All?h? Those will be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are the ones who lied against their Lord.\" Unquestionably, the curse of All?h is upon the wrongdoers\n\n**19** (19) Who averted [people] from the way of All?h and sought to make it [seem] deviant while they, concerning the Hereafter, were disbelievers.\n\n**2** (2) [Through a messenger, saying], \"Do not worship except All?h. Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner and a bringer of good tidings,\"\n\n**20** (20) Those were not causing failure [to All?h] on earth, nor did they have besides All?h any protectors. For them the punishment will be multiplied. They were not able to hear, nor did they see.[557]\n\n**21** (21) Those are the ones who will have lost themselves, and lost from them is what they used to invent.\n\n**22** (22) Assuredly, it is they in the Hereafter who will be the greatest losers.\n\n**23** (23) Indeed, they who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves to their Lord - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide eternally therein.\n\n**24** (24) The example of the two parties is like the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Then, will you not remember?\n\n**25** (25) And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, [saying], \"Indeed, I am to you a clear warner\n\n**26** (26) That you not worship except All?h. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.\"\n\n**27** (27) So the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, \"We do not see you but as a man like ourselves, and we do not see you followed except by those who are the lowest of us [and] at first suggestion.[558] And we do not see in you over us any merit; rather, we think you are liars.\"\n\n**28** (28) He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord while He has given me mercy from Himself but it has been made unapparent to you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?\n\n**29** (29) And O my people, I ask not of you for it any wealth. My reward is not but from All?h. And I am not one to drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.\n\n**3** (3) And [saying], \"Seek forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him, [and] He will let you enjoy a good provision for a specified term and give every doer of favor his favor [i.e., reward]. But if you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great Day.\n\n**30** (30) And O my people, who would protect me from All?h if I drove them away? Then will you not be reminded?\n\n**31** (31) And I do not tell you that I have the depositories [containing the provision] of All?h or that I know the unseen, nor do I tell you that I am an angel, nor do I say of those upon whom your eyes look down that All?h will never grant them any good. All?h is most knowing of what is within their souls. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\"\n\n**32** (32) They said, \"O Noah, you have disputed [i.e., opposed] us and been frequent in dispute of us. So bring us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**33** (33) He said, \"All?h will only bring it to you if He wills, and you will not cause [Him] failure.\n\n**34** (34) And my advice will not benefit you - although I wished to advise you - if All?h should intend to put you in error. He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned.\"\n\n**35** (35) Or do they say [about Prophet Mu?ammad (?)], \"He invented it\"? Say, \"If I have invented it, then upon me is [the consequence of] my crime; but I am innocent of what [crimes] you commit.\"\n\n**36** (36) And it was revealed to Noah that, \"No one will believe from your people except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing.\n\n**37** (37) And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are [to be] drowned.\"\n\n**38** (38) And he constructed the ship, and whenever an assembly of the eminent of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, \"If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you just as you ridicule.\n\n**39** (39) And you are going to know who will get a punishment that will disgrace him [on earth] and upon whom will descend an enduring punishment [in the Hereafter].\"\n\n**4** (4) To All?h is your return, and He is over all things competent.\"\n\n**40** (40) [So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed,[559] We said, \"Load upon it [i.e., the ship] of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word [i.e., decree] has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed.\" But none had believed with him, except a few.\n\n**41** (41) And [Noah] said, \"Embark therein; in the name of All?h [are] its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**42** (42) And it sailed with them through waves like mountains, and Noah called to his son who was apart [from them], \"O my son, come aboard with us and be not with the disbelievers.\"\n\n**43** (43) [But] he said, \"I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.\" [Noah] said, \"There is no protector today from the decree of All?h, except for whom He gives mercy.\" And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.\n\n**44** (44) And it was said, \"O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, withhold [your rain].\" And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and it [i.e., the ship] came to rest on the [mountain of] J?diyy. And it was said, \"Away with the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**45** (45) And Noah called to his Lord and said, \"My Lord, indeed my son is of my family; and indeed, Your promise is true; and You are the most just of judges!\"\n\n**46** (46) He said, \"O Noah, indeed he is not of your family; indeed, he is [one whose] work was other than righteous, so ask Me not for that about which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you, lest you be among the ignorant.\"\n\n**47** (47) [Noah] said, \"My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.\"\n\n**48** (48) It was said, \"O Noah, disembark in security from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations [descending] from those with you. But other nations [of them] We will grant enjoyment; then there will touch them from Us a painful punishment.\"\n\n**49** (49) That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Mu?ammad]. You knew it not, neither you nor your people, before this. So be patient; indeed, the [best] outcome is for the righteous.\n\n**5** (5) Unquestionably, they [i.e., the disbelievers] turn away their breasts to hide themselves from him. Unquestionably, [even] when they cover themselves in their clothing, He [i.e., All?h] knows what they conceal and what they declare. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**50** (50) And to ?Aad [We sent] their brother H?d. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood].\n\n**51** (51) O my people, I do not ask you for it [i.e., my advice] any reward. My reward is only from the one who created me. Then will you not reason?\n\n**52** (52) And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and increase you in strength [added] to your strength. And do not turn away, [being] criminals.\"\n\n**53** (53) They said, \"O H?d, you have not brought us clear evidence, and we are not ones to leave our gods on your say-so. Nor are we believers in you.\n\n**54** (54) We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil [i.e., insanity].\" He said, \"Indeed, I call All?h to witness, and witness [yourselves] that I am free from whatever you associate with All?h\n\n**55** (55) Other than Him. So plot against me all together; then do not give me respite.\n\n**56** (56) Indeed, I have relied upon All?h, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but that He holds it by its forelock [i.e., controls it]. Indeed, my Lord is on a path [that is] straight.\n\n**57** (57) But if you turn away, then I have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you. My Lord will give succession to a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed my Lord is, over all things, Guardian.\"[560]\n\n**58** (58) And when Our command came, We saved H?d and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us; and We saved them from a harsh punishment.\n\n**59** (59) And that was ?Aad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant.\n\n**6** (6) And there is no creature on earth but that upon All?h is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage.[548] All is in a clear register.\n\n**60** (60) And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, ?Aad denied their Lord; then away with ?Aad, the people of H?d.\n\n**61** (61) And to Tham?d [We sent] their brother ??li?. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive.\"\n\n**62** (62) They said, \"O ??li?, you were among us a man of promise before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? And indeed we are, about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt.\"\n\n**63** (63) He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I should be upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself, who would protect me from All?h if I disobeyed Him? So you would not increase me except in loss.\n\n**64** (64) And O my people, this is the she-camel of All?h - [she is] to you a sign. So let her feed upon All?h's earth and do not touch her with harm, or you will be taken by an impending punishment.\"\n\n**65** (65) But they hamstrung her, so he said, \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise not to be denied [i.e., unfailing].\"\n\n**66** (66) So when Our command came, We saved ??li? and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us, and [saved them] from the disgrace of that day.[561] Indeed, it is your Lord who is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.\n\n**67** (67) And the shriek[562] seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone\n\n**68** (68) As if they had never prospered therein. Unquestionably, Tham?d denied their Lord; then, away with Tham?d.\n\n**69** (69) And certainly did Our messengers [i.e., angels] come to Abraham with good tidings; they said, \"Peace.\" He said, \"Peace,\" and did not delay in bringing [them] a roasted calf.\n\n**7** (7) And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water - that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say, \"Indeed, you are resurrected after death,\" those who disbelieve will surely say, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"\n\n**70** (70) But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he distrusted them and felt from them apprehension.[563] They said, \"Fear not. We have been sent to the people of Lot.\"\n\n**71** (71) And his wife was standing, and she smiled.[564] Then We gave her good tidings of Isaac and after Isaac, Jacob.\n\n**72** (72) She said, \"Woe to me![565] Shall I give birth while I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? Indeed, this is an amazing thing!\"\n\n**73** (73) They said, \"Are you amazed at the decree of All?h? May the mercy of All?h and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.\"\n\n**74** (74) And when the fright had left Abraham and the good tidings had reached him, he began to argue [i.e., plead] with Us[566] concerning the people of Lot.\n\n**75** (75) Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, grieving[567] and [frequently] returning [to All?h].\n\n**76** (76) [The angels said], \"O Abraham, give up this [plea]. Indeed, the command of your Lord has come, and indeed, there will reach them a punishment that cannot be repelled.\"\n\n**77** (77) And when Our messengers, [the angels], came to Lot, he was anguished for them and felt for them great discomfort[568] and said, \"This is a trying day.\"\n\n**78** (78) And his people came hastening to him, and before [this] they had been doing evil deeds.[569] He said, \"O my people, these are my daughters;[570] they are purer for you. So fear All?h and do not disgrace me concerning my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?\"\n\n**79** (79) They said, \"You have already known that we have not concerning your daughters [i.e., women] any claim [i.e., desire], and indeed, you know what we want.\"\n\n**8** (8) And if We hold back from them the punishment for a limited time, they will surely say,[549] \"What detains it?\" Unquestionably, on the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**80** (80) He said, \"If only I had against you some power or could take refuge in a strong support.\"\n\n**81** (81) They [the angels] said, \"O Lot, indeed we are messengers of your Lord; [therefore], they will never reach you. So set out with your family during a portion of the night[571] and let not any among you look back - except your wife; indeed, she will be struck by that which strikes them. Indeed, their appointment is [for] the morning. Is not the morning near?\"\n\n**82** (82) So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were]\n\n**83** (83) Marked from your Lord. And it [i.e., All?h's punishment] is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.\n\n**84** (84) And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu?ayb. He said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him. And do not decrease from the measure and the scale. Indeed, I see you in prosperity, but indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an all-encompassing Day.\n\n**85** (85) And O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\n\n**86** (86) What remains [lawful] from All?h is best for you, if you would be believers. But I am not a guardian over you.\"\n\n**87** (87) They said, \"O Shu?ayb, does your prayer [i.e., religion] command you that we should leave what our fathers worship or not do with our wealth what we please? Indeed, you are the forbearing, the discerning!\"[572]\n\n**88** (88) He said, \"O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me with a good provision from Him...?[573] And I do not intend to differ from you in that which I have forbidden you; I only intend reform as much as I am able. And my success is not but through All?h. Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return.[574]\n\n**89** (89) And O my people, let not [your] dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of Noah or the people of H?d or the people of ??li?. And the people of Lot are not from you far away.\n\n**9** (9) And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us and then We withdraw it from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful.\n\n**90** (90) And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affectionate.\"\n\n**91** (91) They said, \"O Shu?ayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and indeed, we consider you among us as weak. And if not for your family, we would have stoned you [to death]; and you are not to us one respected.\"\n\n**92** (92) He said, \"O my people, is my family more respected for power by you than All?h? But you put Him behind your backs [in neglect]. Indeed, my Lord is encompassing of what you do.\n\n**93** (93) And O my people, work according to your position; indeed, I am working. You are going to know to whom will come a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar. So watch; indeed, I am with you a watcher, [awaiting the outcome].\"\n\n**94** (94) And when Our command came, We saved Shu?ayb and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us. And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone\n\n**95** (95) As if they had never prospered therein. Then, away with Madyan as Tham?d was taken away.\n\n**96** (96) And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority[575]\n\n**97** (97) To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not [at all] discerning.\n\n**98** (98) He will precede his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire; and wretched is the place to which they are led.\n\n**99** (99) And they were followed in this [world] with a curse and on the Day of Resurrection. And wretched is the gift[576] which is given."

    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, R?.[582] These are the verses of the clear Book.\n\n**10** (10) Said a speaker among them, \"Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something].\"\n\n**100** (100) And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration.[618] And he said, \"O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle[619] in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\n\n**101** (101) My Lord, You have given me [something] of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and earth, You are my protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous.\"\n\n**102** (102) That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal, [O Mu?ammad], to you. And you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired.\n\n**103** (103) And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers.\n\n**104** (104) And you do not ask of them for it any payment. It is not except a reminder to the worlds.\n\n**105** (105) And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away.\n\n**106** (106) And most of them believe not in All?h except while they associate others with Him.\n\n**107** (107) Then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming [aspect] of the punishment of All?h or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive?\n\n**108** (108) Say, \"This is my way; I invite to All?h with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is All?h; and I am not of those who associate others with Him.\"\n\n**109** (109) And We sent not before you [as messengers] except men to whom We revealed from among the people of cities. So have they[620] not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? And the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear All?h; then will you not reason?\n\n**11** (11) They said, \"O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors?\n\n**110** (110) [They continued] until, when the messengers despaired and were certain that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and whoever We willed was saved. And Our punishment cannot be repelled from the people who are criminals.\n\n**111** (111) There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. Never was it [i.e., the Qur�?n] a narration invented, but a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.\n\n**12** (12) Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians.\"\n\n**13** (13) [Jacob] said, \"Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware.\"\n\n**14** (14) They said, \"If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers.\"\n\n**15** (15) So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well...[587] But We inspired to him, \"You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity].\"\n\n**16** (16) And they came to their father at night, weeping.\n\n**17** (17) They said, \"O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful.\"\n\n**18** (18) And they brought upon his shirt false blood.[588] [Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And All?h is the one sought for help against that which you describe.\"\n\n**19** (19) And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, \"Good news! Here is a boy.\" And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise;[589] and All?h was Knowing of what they did.\n\n**2** (2) Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur�?n[583] that you might understand.\n\n**20** (20) And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little.\n\n**21** (21) And the one from Egypt[590] who bought him said to his wife, \"Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.\" And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events [i.e., dreams]. And All?h is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**22** (22) And when he [i.e., Joseph] reached maturity, We gave him judgement and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good.\n\n**23** (23) And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, \"Come, you.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of All?h. Indeed, he[591] is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\"\n\n**24** (24) And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof [i.e., sign] of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants.\n\n**25** (25) And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, \"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?\"\n\n**26** (26) [Joseph] said, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" And a witness from her family testified, \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars.\n\n**27** (27) But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.\"\n\n**28** (28) So when he [i.e., her husband] saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, \"Indeed, it is of your [i.e., women's] plan. Indeed, your plan is great [i.e., vehement].\n\n**29** (29) Joseph, ignore this.[592] And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful.\"\n\n**3** (3) We relate to you, [O Mu?ammad], the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur�?n although you were, before it, among the unaware.\n\n**30** (30) And women in the city said, \"The wife of al-?Azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error.\"\n\n**31** (31) So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands[593] and said, \"Perfect is All?h![594] This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.\"\n\n**32** (32) She said, \"That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased.\"\n\n**33** (33) He said, \"My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant.\"\n\n**34** (34) So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**35** (35) Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs[595] that he [i.e., al-?Azeez] should surely imprison him for a time.[596]\n\n**36** (36) And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing [grapes for] wine.\" The other said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good.\"\n\n**37** (37) He said, \"You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in All?h, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers.\n\n**38** (38) And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with All?h. That is from the favor of All?h upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful.\n\n**39** (39) O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or All?h, the One,[597] the Prevailing?[598]\n\n**4** (4) [Of these stories mention] when Joseph said to his father,[584] \"O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.\"\n\n**40** (40) You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them,[599] you and your fathers, for which All?h has sent down no evidence. Legislation is not but for All?h. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**41** (41) O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire.\"\n\n**42** (42) And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, \"Mention me before your master.\" But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and he [i.e., Joseph] remained in prison several years.\n\n**43** (43) And [subsequently] the king said, \"Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions.\"\n\n**44** (44) They said, \"[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams.\"\n\n**45** (45) But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, \"I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.\"\n\n**46** (46) [He said], \"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people [i.e., the king and his court]; perhaps they will know [about you].\"\n\n**47** (47) [Joseph] said, \"You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat.\n\n**48** (48) Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you advanced [i.e., saved] for them, except a little from which you will store.\n\n**49** (49) Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes].\"\n\n**5** (5) He said, \"O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan. Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy.\n\n**50** (50) And the king said, \"Bring him to me.\" But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, \"Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan.\"\n\n**51** (51) Said [the king to the women], \"What was your condition when you sought to seduce Joseph?\" They said, \"Perfect is All?h![600] We know about him no evil.\" The wife of al-?Azeez said, \"Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful.\n\n**52** (52) That is so he [i.e., al-?Azeez] will know that I did not betray him in [his] absence and that All?h does not guide the plan of betrayers.\n\n**53** (53) And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\"[601]\n\n**54** (54) And the king said, \"Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself.\" And when he spoke to him, he said, \"Indeed, you are today established [in position] and trusted.\"\n\n**55** (55) [Joseph] said, \"Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian.\"\n\n**56** (56) And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\n\n**57** (57) And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing All?h.\n\n**58** (58) And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown.[602]\n\n**59** (59) And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, \"Bring me a brother of yours from your father.[603] Do you not see that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators?\n\n**6** (6) And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives [i.e., events or dreams] and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise.\"\n\n**60** (60) But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me.\"\n\n**61** (61) They said, \"We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it].\"\n\n**62** (62) And [Joseph] said to his servants, \"Put their merchandise[604] into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return.\"\n\n**63** (63) So when they returned to their father, they said, \"O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. And indeed, we will be his guardians.\"\n\n**64** (64) He said, \"Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But All?h is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful.\"\n\n**65** (65) And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, \"O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies [i.e., food] for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement.\"[605]\n\n**66** (66) [Jacob] said, \"Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise [i.e., oath] by All?h that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded [i.e., overcome by enemies].\" And when they had given their promise, he said, \"All?h, over what we say, is Entrusted.\"[606]\n\n**67** (67) And he said, \"O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] All?h at all. The decision is only for All?h; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\"\n\n**68** (68) And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against All?h at all except [it was] a need [i.e., concern] within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**69** (69) And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, \"Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me].\"\n\n**7** (7) Certainly were there in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who ask, [such as]\n\n**70** (70) So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, \"O caravan, indeed you are thieves.\"\n\n**71** (71) They said while approaching them, \"What is it you are missing?\"\n\n**72** (72) They said, \"We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it.\"\n\n**73** (73) They said, \"By All?h, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.\"\n\n**74** (74) They [the accusers] said, \"Then what would be its recompense[607] if you should be liars?\"\n\n**75** (75) [The brothers] said, \"Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense.[608] Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**76** (76) So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion [i.e., law] of the king except that All?h willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing.[609]\n\n**77** (77) They said, \"If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before.\" But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them.[610] He said, \"You are worse in position, and All?h is most knowing of what you describe.\"\n\n**78** (78) They said, \"O ?Azeez,[611] indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good.\"\n\n**79** (79) He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of All?h [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. Indeed, we would then be unjust.\"\n\n**8** (8) When they said, \"Joseph and his brother[585] are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a clan. Indeed, our father is in clear error.\n\n**80** (80) So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves in private consultation. The eldest of them said, \"Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by All?h and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph? So I will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or All?h decides for me,[612] and He is the best of judges.\n\n**81** (81) Return to your father and say, 'O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen.[613]\n\n**82** (82) And ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed, we are truthful.'\"\n\n**83** (83) [Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps All?h will bring them to me all together. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\"\n\n**84** (84) And he turned away from them and said, \"Oh, my sorrow over Joseph,\" and his eyes became white[614] from grief, for he was [of that] a suppressor.[615]\n\n**85** (85) They said, \"By All?h, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish.\"\n\n**86** (86) He said, \"I only complain of my suffering and my grief to All?h, and I know from All?h that which you do not know.\n\n**87** (87) O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from All?h. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from All?h except the disbelieving people.\"\n\n**88** (88) So when they entered upon him [i.e., Joseph], they said, \"O ?Azeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, All?h rewards the charitable.\"\n\n**89** (89) He said, \"Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?\"\n\n**9** (9) Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance [i.e., attention] of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people.\"[586]\n\n**90** (90) They said, \"Are you indeed Joseph?\" He said, \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. All?h has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears All?h and is patient, then indeed, All?h does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\"\n\n**91** (91) They said, \"By All?h, certainly has All?h preferred you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners.\"\n\n**92** (92) He said, \"No blame will there be upon you today. May All?h forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful.\n\n**93** (93) Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together.\"\n\n**94** (94) And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said,[616] \"Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind.\"\n\n**95** (95) They said, \"By All?h, indeed you are in your [same] old error.\"\n\n**96** (96) And when the bearer of good tidings[617] arrived, he cast it over his face, and he returned [once again] seeing. He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know from All?h that which you do not know?\"\n\n**97** (97) They said, \"O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners.\"\n\n**98** (98) He said, \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\n**99** (99) And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself [i.e., embraced them] and said, \"Enter Egypt, All?h willing, safe [and secure].\""

    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, Meem, R?.[622] These are the verses of the Book; and what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most of the people do not believe.\n\n**10** (10) It is the same [to Him] concerning you whether one conceals [his] speech or publicizes it and whether one is hidden by night or conspicuous [among others] by day.\n\n**11** (11) For him [i.e., each one] are successive [angels][631] before and behind him who protect him by the decree of All?h.[632] Indeed, All?h will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when All?h intends for a people ill,[633] there is no repelling it. And there is not for them besides Him any patron.\n\n**12** (12) It is He who shows you lightning, [causing] fear and aspiration, and generates the heavy clouds.\n\n**13** (13) And the thunder exalts [All?h] with praise of Him - and the angels [as well] from fear of Him - and He sends thunderbolts and strikes therewith whom He wills while they dispute about All?h; and He is severe in assault.\n\n**14** (14) To Him [alone] is the supplication of truth. And those they call upon besides Him do not respond to them with a thing, except as one who stretches his hands toward water [from afar, calling it] to reach his mouth, but it will not reach it [thus].[634] And the supplication of the disbelievers is not but in error [i.e., futility].\n\n**15** (15) And to All?h prostrates whoever is within the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and their shadows [as well] in the mornings and the afternoons.\n\n**16** (16) Say, \"Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?\" Say, \"All?h.\" Say, \"Have you then taken besides Him allies not possessing [even] for themselves any benefit or any harm?\" Say, \"Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Or is darkness equivalent to light? Or have they attributed to All?h partners who created like His creation so that the creation [of each] seemed similar to them?\"[635] Say, \"All?h is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Prevailing.\"[636]\n\n**17** (17) He sends down from the sky, rain, and valleys flow according to their capacity, and the torrent carries a rising foam. And from that [ore] which they heat in the fire, desiring adornments and utensils, is a foam like it. Thus All?h presents [the example of] truth and falsehood. As for the foam, it vanishes, [being] cast off; but as for that which benefits the people, it remains on the earth. Thus does All?h present examples.\n\n**18** (18) For those who have responded to their Lord is the best [reward], but those who did not respond to Him - if they had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselves thereby. Those will have the worst account, and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.\n\n**19** (19) Then is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like one who is blind? They will only be reminded who are people of understanding -\n\n**2** (2) It is All?h who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can] see; then He established Himself above the Throne[623] and made subject[624] the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. He arranges [each] matter; He details the signs that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain.\n\n**20** (20) Those who fulfill the covenant of All?h and do not break the contract,\n\n**21** (21) And those who join that which All?h has ordered to be joined[637] and fear their Lord and are afraid of the evil of [their] account,\n\n**22** (22) And those who are patient, seeking the face [i.e., acceptance] of their Lord, and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and prevent evil with good - those will have the good consequence of [this] home[638] -\n\n**23** (23) Gardens of perpetual residence; they will enter them with whoever were righteous among their forefathers, their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate, [saying],\n\n**24** (24) \"Peace [i.e., security] be upon you for what you patiently endured.\" And excellent is the final home.\n\n**25** (25) But those who break the covenant of All?h after contracting it and sever that which All?h has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth - for them is the curse, and they will have the worst home.[639]\n\n**26** (26) All?h extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. And they rejoice in the worldly life, while the worldly life is not, compared to the Hereafter, except [brief] enjoyment.\n\n**27** (27) And those who disbelieved say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Indeed, All?h leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him] -\n\n**28** (28) Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of All?h. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of All?h hearts are assured.\"\n\n**29** (29) Those who have believed and done righteous deeds - a good state is theirs and a good return.\n\n**3** (3) And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates; He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.\n\n**30** (30) Thus have We sent you to a community before which [other] communities have passed on so you might recite to them that which We revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Merciful. Say, \"He is my Lord; there is no deity except Him. Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return.\"\n\n**31** (31) And if there was any Qur�?n [i.e., recitation] by which the mountains would be removed or the earth would be broken apart or the dead would be made to speak,[640] [it would be this Qur�?n], but to All?h belongs the affair entirely. Then have those who believed not accepted that had All?h willed, He would have guided the people, all of them? And those who disbelieve do not cease to be struck, for what they have done, by calamity - or it will descend near their home - until there comes the promise of All?h. Indeed, All?h does not fail in [His] promise.\n\n**32** (32) And already were [other] messengers ridiculed before you, and I extended the time of those who disbelieved; then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.\n\n**33** (33) Then is He who is a maintainer of every soul, [knowing] what it has earned, [like any other]? But to All?h they have attributed partners. Say, \"Name them. Or do you inform Him of that[641] which He knows not upon the earth or of what is apparent [i.e., alleged] of speech?\"[642] Rather, their [own] plan has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have been averted from the way. And whomever All?h sends astray - there will be for him no guide.\n\n**34** (34) For them will be punishment in the life of [this] world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe. And they will not have from All?h any protector.\n\n**35** (35) The example [i.e., description] of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised, is [that] beneath it rivers flow. Its fruit is lasting, and its shade. That is the consequence for the righteous, and the consequence for the disbelievers is the Fire.\n\n**36** (36) And [the believers among] those to whom We have given the [previous] Scripture rejoice at what has been revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], but among the [opposing] factions are those who deny part of it [i.e., the Qur�?n]. Say, \"I have only been commanded to worship All?h and not associate [anything] with Him. To Him I invite, and to Him is my return.\"\n\n**37** (37) And thus We have revealed it as an Arabic legislation.[643] And if you should follow their inclinations after what has come to you of knowledge, you would not have against All?h any ally or any protector.\n\n**38** (38) And We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants. And it was not for a messenger to come with a sign except by permission of All?h. For every term is a decree.\n\n**39** (39) All?h eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.[644]\n\n**4** (4) And within the land are neighboring plots and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees, [growing] several from a root or otherwise,[625] watered with one water; but We make some of them exceed others in [quality of] fruit. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.\n\n**40** (40) And whether We show you part of what We promise them or take you in death, upon you is only the [duty of] notification, and upon Us is the account.\n\n**41** (41) Have they not seen that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders?[645] And All?h decides; there is no adjuster of His decision. And He is swift in account.\n\n**42** (42) And those before them had plotted, but to All?h belongs the plan entirely. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home.\n\n**43** (43) And those who have disbelieved say, \"You are not a messenger.\" Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Sufficient is All?h as Witness between me and you, and [the witness of] whoever has knowledge of the Scripture.\"[646]\n\n**5** (5) And if you are astonished,[626] [O Mu?ammad] - then astonishing is their saying, \"When we are dust, will we indeed be [brought] into a new creation?\" Those are the ones who have disbelieved in their Lord, and those will have shackles[627] upon their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.\n\n**6** (6) They impatiently urge you to bring about evil before good,[628] while there has already occurred before them similar punishments [to what they demand]. And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of forgiveness for the people despite their wrongdoing, and indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty.\n\n**7** (7) And those who disbelieved say, \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.\n\n**8** (8) All?h knows what every female carries[629] and what the wombs lose [prematurely] or exceed.[630] And everything with Him is by due measure.\n\n**9** (9) [He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, the Exalted."

He invites you that He may forgive you of your sins, and He delays you [i.e., your death] for a specified term.\" They said, \"You are not but men like us who wish to avert us from what our fathers were worshipping. So bring us a clear authority [i.e., evidence].\"\n\n**11** (11) Their messengers said to them, \"We are only men like you, but All?h confers favor upon whom He wills of His servants. It has never been for us to bring you evidence except by permission of All?h. And upon All?h let the believers rely.\n\n**12** (12) And why should we not rely upon All?h while He has guided us to our [good] ways. And we will surely be patient against whatever harm you should cause us. And upon All?h let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\"\n\n**13** (13) And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, \"We will surely drive you out of our land, or you must return to our religion.\" So their Lord inspired to them, \"We will surely destroy the wrongdoers.\n\n**14** (14) And We will surely cause you to dwell in the land after them. That is for he who fears My position[652] and fears My threat.\"\n\n**15** (15) And they requested decision [i.e., victory from All?h], and disappointed, [therefore], was every obstinate tyrant.\n\n**16** (16) Before him[653] is Hell, and he will be given a drink of purulent water.[654]\n\n**17** (17) He will gulp it but will hardly [be able to] swallow it. And death will come to him from everywhere, but he is not to die. And before him is a massive punishment.\n\n**18** (18) The example of those who disbelieve in their Lord is [that] their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day; they are unable [to keep] from what they earned a [single] thing. That is what is extreme error.\n\n**19** (19) Have you not seen [i.e., considered] that All?h created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can do away with you and produce a new creation.\n\n**2** (2) All?h, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And woe [i.e., destruction] to the disbelievers from a severe punishment -\n\n**20** (20) And that is not difficult for All?h.\n\n**21** (21) And they will come out [for judgement] before All?h all together, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, \"Indeed, we were your followers, so can you avail us anything against the punishment of All?h?\" They will say, \"If All?h had guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we show intolerance or are patient: there is for us no place of escape.\"\n\n**22** (22) And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, \"Indeed, All?h had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; but blame yourselves. I cannot be called to your aid, nor can you be called to my aid. Indeed, I deny your association of me [with All?h] before.[655] Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment.\"\n\n**23** (23) And those who believed and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein by permission of their Lord; and their greeting therein will be, \"Peace!\"\n\n**24** (24) Have you not considered how All?h presents an example, [making] a good word like a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches [high] in the sky?\n\n**25** (25) It produces its fruit all the time, by permission of its Lord. And All?h presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded.\n\n**26** (26) And the example of a bad word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the surface of the earth, not having any stability.\n\n**27** (27) All?h keeps firm those who believe, with the firm word,[656] in worldly life and in the Hereafter.[657] And All?h sends astray the wrongdoers. And All?h does what He wills.\n\n**28** (28) Have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of All?h for disbelief[658] and settled their people [in] the home of ruin?\n\n**29** (29) [It is] Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the settlement.\n\n**3** (3) The ones who prefer the worldly life over the Hereafter and avert [people] from the way of All?h, seeking to make it [seem] deviant. Those are in extreme error.\n\n**30** (30) And they have attributed to All?h equals to mislead [people] from His way. Say, \"Enjoy yourselves, for indeed, your destination is the Fire.\"\n\n**31** (31) [O Mu?ammad], tell My servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, before a Day comes in which there will be no exchange [i.e., ransom], nor any friendships.\n\n**32** (32) It is All?h who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you[659] the ships to sail through the sea by His command and subjected for you the rivers.\n\n**33** (33) And He subjected for you the sun and the moon, continuous [in orbit], and subjected for you the night and the day.\n\n**34** (34) And He gave you from all you asked of Him.[660] And if you should count the favor [i.e., blessings] of All?h, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.[661]\n\n**35** (35) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Abraham said, \"My Lord, make this city [i.e., Makkah] secure and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.\n\n**36** (36) My Lord, indeed they have led astray many among the people. So whoever follows me - then he is of me;[662] and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are [yet] Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**37** (37) Our Lord, I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they might be grateful.\n\n**38** (38) Our Lord, indeed You know what we conceal and what we declare, and nothing is hidden from All?h on the earth or in the heaven.\n\n**39** (39) Praise to All?h, who has granted to me in old age Ishmael and Isaac. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication.\n\n**4** (4) And We did not send any messenger except [speaking] in the language of his people to state clearly for them, and All?h sends astray [thereby] whom He wills[649] and guides whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**40** (40) My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and [many] from my descendants. Our Lord, and accept my supplication.\n\n**41** (41) Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers the Day the account is established.\"\n\n**42** (42) And never think that All?h is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them [i.e., their account] for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror].\n\n**43** (43) Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come back to them,[663] and their hearts are void.\n\n**44** (44) And, [O Mu?ammad], warn the people of a Day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say, \"Our Lord, delay us for a short term; we will answer Your call and follow the messengers.\" [But it will be said], \"Had you not sworn, before, that for you there would be no cessation?[664]\n\n**45** (45) And you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it had become clear to you how We dealt with them. And We presented for you [many] examples.\"\n\n**46** (46) And they had planned their plan, but with All?h is [recorded] their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains.[665]\n\n**47** (47) So never think that All?h will fail in His promise to His messengers. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.[666]\n\n**48** (48) [It will be] on the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens [as well], and they [i.e., all creatures] will come out before All?h, the One, the Prevailing,\n\n**49** (49) And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in irons,\n\n**5** (5) And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], \"Bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days[650] of All?h.\" Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.\n\n**50** (50) Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire\n\n**51** (51) So that All?h will recompense every soul for what it earned. Indeed, All?h is swift in account.\n\n**52** (52) This [Qur�?n] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.\n\n**6** (6) And [recall, O Children of Israel], when Moses said to his people, \"Remember the favor of All?h upon you when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst torment and were slaughtering your [newborn] sons and keeping your females alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.\n\n**7** (7) And [remember] when your Lord proclaimed, 'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe.'\"\n\n**8** (8) And Moses said, \"If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - indeed, All?h is Free of need and Praiseworthy.\"\n\n**9** (9) Has there not reached you the news of those before you - the people of Noah and ?Aad and Tham?d and those after them? No one knows them [i.e., their number] but All?h. Their messengers brought them clear proofs, but they returned their hands to their mouths[651] and said, \"Indeed, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and indeed we are, about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt.\""

And you are not its retainers.\n\n**23** (23) And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritor.[674]\n\n**24** (24) And We have already known the preceding [generations] among you, and We have already known the later [ones to come].\n\n**25** (25) And indeed, your Lord will gather them; indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.\n\n**26** (26) And We did certainly create man out of clay from an altered black mud.\n\n**27** (27) And the jinn We created before from scorching fire.\n\n**28** (28) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when your Lord said to the angels, \"I will create a human being out of clay from an altered black mud.\n\n**29** (29) And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul,[675] then fall down to him in prostration.\"\n\n**3** (3) Let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by [false] hope, for they are going to know.\n\n**30** (30) So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,\n\n**31** (31) Except Iblees;[676] he refused to be with those who prostrated.\n\n**32** (32) [All?h] said, \"O Iblees, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?\"\n\n**33** (33) He said, \"Never would I prostrate to a human whom You created out of clay from an altered black mud.\"\n\n**34** (34) [All?h] said, \"Then depart from it,[677] for indeed, you are expelled.\n\n**35** (35) And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Recompense.\"\n\n**36** (36) He said, \"My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.\"\n\n**37** (37) [All?h] said, \"So indeed, you are of those reprieved\n\n**38** (38) Until the Day of the time well-known.\"\n\n**39** (39) [Iblees] said, \"My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them [i.e., mankind] on earth, and I will mislead them all\n\n**4** (4) And We did not destroy any city but that for it was a known decree.\n\n**40** (40) Except, among them, Your chosen servants.\"\n\n**41** (41) [All?h] said, \"This is a path [of return] to Me [that is] straight.\n\n**42** (42) Indeed, My servants - no authority will you have over them, except those who follow you of the deviators.\n\n**43** (43) And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all.\n\n**44** (44) It has seven gates; for every gate is of them [i.e., Satan's followers] a portion designated.\"\n\n**45** (45) Indeed, the righteous will be within gardens and springs,\n\n**46** (46) [Having been told], \"Enter it in peace, safe [and secure].\"\n\n**47** (47) And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment,[678] [so they will be] brothers, on thrones facing each other.\n\n**48** (48) No fatigue will touch them therein, nor from it will they [ever] be removed.\n\n**49** (49) [O Mu?ammad], inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful,\n\n**5** (5) No nation will precede its term, nor will they remain thereafter.\n\n**50** (50) And that it is My punishment which is the painful punishment.\n\n**51** (51) And inform them about the guests of Abraham,\n\n**52** (52) When they entered upon him and said, \"Peace.\" [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, we are fearful [i.e., apprehensive] of you.\"\n\n**53** (53) [The angels] said, \"Fear not. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy.\"\n\n**54** (54) He said, \"Have you given me good tidings although old age has come upon me? Then of what [wonder] do you inform?\"\n\n**55** (55) They said, \"We have given you good tidings in truth, so do not be of the despairing.\"\n\n**56** (56) He said, \"And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?\"\n\n**57** (57) [Abraham] said, \"Then what is your business [here], O messengers?\"\n\n**58** (58) They said, \"Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals,\n\n**59** (59) Except the family of Lot; indeed, we will save them all\n\n**6** (6) And they say, \"O you upon whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad.[670]\n\n**60** (60) Except his wife.\" We [i.e., All?h] decreed that she is of those who remain behind.[679]\n\n**61** (61) And when the messengers came to the family of Lot,\n\n**62** (62) He said, \"Indeed, you are people unknown.\"\n\n**63** (63) They said, \"But we have come to you with that about which they were disputing,\n\n**64** (64) And we have come to you with truth, and indeed, we are truthful.\n\n**65** (65) So set out with your family during a portion of the night and follow behind them and let not anyone among you look back and continue on to where you are commanded.\"\n\n**66** (66) And We conveyed to him [the decree] of that matter: that those [sinners] would be eliminated by early morning.\n\n**67** (67) And the people of the city came rejoicing.[680]\n\n**68** (68) [Lot] said, \"Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me.\n\n**69** (69) And fear All?h and do not disgrace me.\"\n\n**7** (7) Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be among the truthful?\"\n\n**70** (70) They said, \"Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?\"\n\n**71** (71) [Lot] said, \"These are my daughters[681] - if you would be doers [of lawful marriage].\"\n\n**72** (72) By your life, [O Mu?ammad], indeed they were, in their intoxication, wandering blindly.\n\n**73** (73) So the shriek[682] seized them at sunrise.\n\n**74** (74) And We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of hard clay.\n\n**75** (75) Indeed in that are signs for those who discern.\n\n**76** (76) And indeed, they [i.e., those cities] are [situated] on an established road.\n\n**77** (77) Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.\n\n**78** (78) And the companions of the thicket [i.e., the people of Madyan] were [also] wrongdoers,\n\n**79** (79) So We took retribution from them, and indeed, both [cities] are on a clear highway.\n\n**8** (8) We do not send down the angels except with truth;[671] and they [i.e., the disbelievers] would not then be reprieved.\n\n**80** (80) And certainly did the companions of al-?ijr[683] [i.e., the Tham?d] deny the messengers.\n\n**81** (81) And We gave them Our signs, but from them they were turning away.\n\n**82** (82) And they used to carve from the mountains, houses, feeling secure.\n\n**83** (83) But the shriek seized them at early morning,\n\n**84** (84) So nothing availed them [from] what they used to earn.\n\n**85** (85) And We have not created the heavens and earth and that between them except in truth. And indeed, the Hour is coming; so forgive with gracious forgiveness.\n\n**86** (86) Indeed, your Lord - He is the Knowing Creator.\n\n**87** (87) And We have certainly given you, [O Mu?ammad], seven of the often repeated [verses][684] and the great Qur�?n.\n\n**88** (88) Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [certain] categories of them [i.e., the disbelievers], and do not grieve over them. And lower your wing [i.e., show kindness] to the believers.\n\n**89** (89) And say, \"Indeed, I am the clear warner\" -\n\n**9** (9) Indeed, it is We who sent down the message [i.e., the Qur�?n], and indeed, We will be its guardian.\n\n**90** (90) Just as We had revealed [scriptures] to the separators[685]\n\n**91** (91) Who have made the Qur�?n into portions.[686]\n\n**92** (92) So by your Lord, We will surely question them all\n\n**93** (93) About what they used to do.\n\n**94** (94) Then declare what you are commanded[687] and turn away from the polytheists.[688]\n\n**95** (95) Indeed, We are sufficient for you against the mockers\n\n**96** (96) Who make [equal] with All?h another deity. But they are going to know.\n\n**97** (97) And We already know that your breast is constrained by what they say.\n\n**98** (98) So exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord and be of those who prostrate [to Him].\n\n**99** (99) And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty [i.e., death]."

    "content": "**1** (1) The command of All?h is coming,[690] so be not impatient for it. Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\n\n**10** (10) It is He who sends down rain from the sky; from it is drink and from it is foliage in which you pasture [animals].\n\n**100** (100) His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who through him associate others with All?h.\n\n**101** (101) And when We substitute a verse in place of a verse - and All?h is most knowing of what He sends down - they say, \"You, [O Mu?ammad], are but an inventor [of lies].\" But most of them do not know.\n\n**102** (102) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"The Pure Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] has brought it down from your Lord in truth to make firm those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims.\"\n\n**103** (103) And We certainly know that they say, \"It is only a human being who teaches him [i.e., the Prophet (?)].\" The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign,[715] and this [recitation, i.e., Qur�?n] is [in] a clear Arabic language.\n\n**104** (104) Indeed, those who do not believe in the verses of All?h - All?h will not guide them, and for them is a painful punishment.\n\n**105** (105) They only invent falsehood who do not believe in the verses of All?h, and it is those who are the liars.\n\n**106** (106) Whoever disbelieves in [i.e., denies] All?h after his belief...[716] except for one who is forced [to renounce his religion] while his heart is secure in faith. But those who [willingly] open their breasts to disbelief, upon them is wrath from All?h, and for them is a great punishment;\n\n**107** (107) That is because they preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter and that All?h does not guide the disbelieving people.\n\n**108** (108) Those are the ones over whose hearts and hearing and vision All?h has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless.\n\n**109** (109) Assuredly, it is they, in the Hereafter, who will be the losers.\n\n**11** (11) He causes to grow for you thereby the crops, olives, palm trees, grapevines, and of all the fruits. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.\n\n**110** (110) Then, indeed your Lord, to those who emigrated after they had been compelled [to say words of disbelief] and thereafter fought [for the cause of All?h] and were patient - indeed, your Lord, after that, is Forgiving and Merciful\n\n**111** (111) On the Day when every soul will come disputing [i.e., pleading] for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged [i.e., treated unjustly].\n\n**112** (112) And All?h presents an example: a city [i.e., Makkah] which was safe and secure, its provision coming to it in abundance from every location, but it denied the favors of All?h. So All?h made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they had been doing.\n\n**113** (113) And there had certainly come to them a Messenger from among themselves, but they denied him; so punishment overtook them while they were wrongdoers.\n\n**114** (114) Then eat of what All?h has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And be grateful for the favor of All?h, if it is [indeed] Him that you worship.\n\n**115** (115) He has only forbidden to you dead animals,[717] blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than All?h. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit] - then indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**116** (116) And do not say about what your tongues assert of untruth, \"This is lawful and this is unlawful,\" to invent falsehood about All?h. Indeed, those who invent falsehood about All?h will not succeed.\n\n**117** (117) [It is but] a brief enjoyment, and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**118** (118) And to those who are Jews We have prohibited that which We related to you before.[718] And We did not wrong them [thereby], but they were wronging themselves.\n\n**119** (119) Then, indeed your Lord, to those who have done wrong out of ignorance and then repent after that and correct themselves - indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**12** (12) And He has subjected for you the night and day and the sun and moon, and the stars are subjected by His command. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.\n\n**120** (120) Indeed, Abraham was a [comprehensive] leader,[719] devoutly obedient to All?h, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with All?h.\n\n**121** (121) [He was] grateful for His favors. He [i.e., All?h] chose him and guided him to a straight path.\n\n**122** (122) And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.\n\n**123** (123) Then We revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth; and he was not of those who associate with All?h.\n\n**124** (124) The sabbath was only appointed for those who differed over it. And indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\n\n**125** (125) Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.\n\n**126** (126) And if you punish [an enemy, O believers], punish with an equivalent of that with which you were harmed.[720] But if you are patient - it is better for those who are patient.\n\n**127** (127) And be patient, [O Mu?ammad], and your patience is not but through All?h. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they conspire.\n\n**128** (128) Indeed, All?h is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.\n\n**13** (13) And [He has subjected] whatever He multiplied for you on the earth of varying colors. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember.\n\n**14** (14) And it is He who subjected the sea for you to eat from it tender meat and to extract from it ornaments which you wear. And you see the ships plowing through it, and [He subjected it] that you may seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**15** (15) And He has cast into the earth firmly set mountains, lest it shift with you, and [made] rivers and roads, that you may be guided,\n\n**16** (16) And landmarks. And by the stars they are [also] guided.[694]\n\n**17** (17) Then is He who creates like one who does not create? So will you not be reminded?\n\n**18** (18) And if you should count the favors of All?h, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**19** (19) And All?h knows what you conceal and what you declare.\n\n**2** (2) He sends down the angels, with the inspiration [i.e., revelation] of His command, upon whom He wills of His servants, [telling them], \"Warn that there is no deity except Me; so fear Me.\"\n\n**20** (20) And those they invoke other than All?h create nothing, and they [themselves] are created.\n\n**21** (21) They are [in fact] dead,[695] not alive, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected.\n\n**22** (22) Your god is one God. But those who do not believe in the Hereafter - their hearts are disapproving, and they are arrogant.\n\n**23** (23) Assuredly, All?h knows what they conceal and what they declare. Indeed, He does not like the arrogant.\n\n**24** (24) And when it is said to them, \"What has your Lord sent down?\" they say, \"Legends of the former peoples,\"\n\n**25** (25) That they may bear their own burdens [i.e., sins] in full on the Day of Resurrection and some of the burdens of those whom they misguide without [i.e., by lack of] knowledge. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear.\n\n**26** (26) Those before them had already plotted, but All?h came at [i.e., uprooted] their building from the foundations, so the roof fell upon them from above them,[696] and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive.\n\n**27** (27) Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' for whom you used to oppose [the believers]?\" Those who were given knowledge will say, \"Indeed disgrace, this Day, and evil are upon the disbelievers\" -\n\n**28** (28) The ones whom the angels take in death [while] wronging themselves,[697] and [who] then offer submission, [saying], \"We were not doing any evil.\" But, yes! Indeed, All?h is Knowing of what you used to do.\n\n**29** (29) So enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and how wretched is the residence of the arrogant.\n\n**3** (3) He created the heavens and earth in truth. High is He above what they associate with Him.\n\n**30** (30) And it will be said to those who feared All?h, \"What did your Lord send down?\" They will say, \"[That which is] good.\" For those who do good in this world is good; and the home of the Hereafter is better. And how excellent is the home of the righteous -\n\n**31** (31) Gardens of perpetual residence, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow. They will have therein whatever they wish. Thus does All?h reward the righteous -\n\n**32** (32) The ones whom the angels take in death, [being] good and pure; [the angels] will say, \"Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do.\"\n\n**33** (33) Do they [i.e., the disbelievers] await except that the angels should come to them or there comes the command of your Lord? Thus did those do before them. And All?h wronged them not, but they had been wronging themselves.\n\n**34** (34) So they were struck by the evil consequences of what they did and were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**35** (35) And those who associate others with All?h say, \"If All?h had willed, we would not have worshipped anything other than Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything through other than Him.\" Thus did those do before them. So is there upon the messengers except [the duty of] clear notification?\n\n**36** (36) And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], \"Worship All?h and avoid ??gh?t.\"[698] And among them were those whom All?h guided, and among them were those upon whom error was [deservedly] decreed. So proceed [i.e., travel] through the earth and observe how was the end of the deniers.\n\n**37** (37) [Even] if you should strive for their guidance, [O Mu?ammad], indeed, All?h does not guide those He sends astray,[699] and they will have no helpers.\n\n**38** (38) And they swear by All?h their strongest oaths [that] All?h will not resurrect one who dies. But yes - [it is] a true promise [binding] upon Him, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**39** (39) [It is] so He will make clear to them [the truth of] that wherein they differ and so those who have disbelieved may know that they were liars.\n\n**4** (4) He created man from a sperm-drop; then at once[691] he is a clear adversary.\n\n**40** (40) Indeed, Our word to a thing when We intend it is but that We say to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n**41** (41) And those who emigrated for [the cause of] All?h after they had been wronged - We will surely settle them in this world in a good place; but the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if only they could know.\n\n**42** (42) [They are] those who endured patiently and upon their Lord relied.\n\n**43** (43) And We sent not before you except men to whom We revealed [Our message]. So ask the people of the message [i.e., former scriptures] if you do not know.\n\n**44** (44) [We sent them] with clear proofs and written ordinances. And We revealed to you the message [i.e., the Qur�?n] that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought.\n\n**45** (45) Then, do those who have planned evil deeds feel secure that All?h will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive?\n\n**46** (46) Or that He would not seize them during their [usual] activity, and they could not cause failure [i.e., escape from Him]?\n\n**47** (47) Or that He would not seize them gradually [in a state of dread]?[700] But indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.[701]\n\n**48** (48) Have they not considered what things All?h has created? Their shadows incline to the right and to the left, prostrating to All?h, while they [i.e., those creations] are humble.\n\n**49** (49) And to All?h prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures, and the angels [as well], and they are not arrogant.\n\n**5** (5) And the grazing livestock He has created for you; in them is warmth[692] and [numerous] benefits, and from them you eat.\n\n**50** (50) They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.\n\n**51** (51) And All?h has said, \"Do not take for yourselves two[702] deities. He [i.e., All?h] is but one God, so fear only Me.\"\n\n**52** (52) And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is [due] worship constantly. Then is it other than All?h that you fear?\n\n**53** (53) And whatever you have of favor - it is from All?h. Then when adversity touches you, to Him you cry for help.\n\n**54** (54) Then when He removes the adversity from you, at once a party of you associates others with their Lord\n\n**55** (55) So they will deny what We have given them. Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.\n\n**56** (56) And they assign to what they do not know[703] [i.e., false deities] a portion of that which We have provided them. By All?h, you will surely be questioned about what you used to invent.\n\n**57** (57) And they attribute to All?h daughters[704] - exalted is He - and for them is what they desire [i.e., sons].\n\n**58** (58) And when one of them is informed of [the birth of] a female, his face becomes dark, and he suppresses grief.\n\n**59** (59) He hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he has been informed. Should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground? Unquestionably, evil is what they decide.\n\n**6** (6) And for you in them is [the enjoyment of] beauty when you bring them in [for the evening] and when you send them out [to pasture].\n\n**60** (60) For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is the description [i.e., an attribute] of evil;[705] and for All?h is the highest attribute. And He is Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**61** (61) And if All?h were to impose blame on the people for their wrongdoing, He would not have left upon it [i.e., the earth] any creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede [it].\n\n**62** (62) And they attribute to All?h that which they dislike [i.e., daughters], and their tongues assert the lie that they will have the best [from Him]. Assuredly, they will have the Fire, and they will be [therein] neglected.[706]\n\n**63** (63) By All?h, We did certainly send [messengers] to nations before you, but Satan made their deeds attractive to them. And he is their [i.e., the disbelievers] ally today [as well], and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**64** (64) And We have not revealed to you the Book, [O Mu?ammad], except for you to make clear to them that wherein they have differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.\n\n**65** (65) And All?h has sent down rain from the sky and given life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen.\n\n**66** (66) And indeed, for you in grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excretion and blood - pure milk, palatable to drinkers.\n\n**67** (67) And from the fruits of the palm trees and grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision.[707] Indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason.\n\n**68** (68) And your Lord inspired to the bee, \"Take for yourself among the mountains, houses [i.e., hives], and among the trees and [in] that which they construct.\n\n**69** (69) Then eat from all the fruits[708] and follow the ways of your Lord laid down [for you].\" There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought.\n\n**7** (7) And they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty to yourselves. Indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful.\n\n**70** (70) And All?h created you; then He will take you in death. And among you is he who is reversed to the most decrepit [old] age so that he will not know, after [having had] knowledge, a thing. Indeed, All?h is Knowing and Competent.\n\n**71** (71) And All?h has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored [i.e., given more] would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess [i.e., slaves] so they would be equal to them therein.[709] Then is it the favor of All?h they reject?\n\n**72** (72) And All?h has made for you from yourselves mates and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things. Then in falsehood do they believe and in the favor of All?h they disbelieve?\n\n**73** (73) And they worship besides All?h that which does not possess for them [the power of] provision from the heavens and the earth at all, and [in fact], they are unable.\n\n**74** (74) So do not assert similarities to All?h.[710] Indeed, All?h knows and you do not know.\n\n**75** (75) All?h presents an example: a slave [who is] owned and unable to do a thing and he to whom We have provided from Us good provision, so he spends from it secretly and publicly. Can they be equal? Praise to All?h! But most of them do not know.\n\n**76** (76) And All?h presents an example of two men, one of them dumb and unable to do a thing, while he is a burden to his guardian. Wherever he directs him, he brings no good. Is he equal to one who commands justice, while he is on a straight path?\n\n**77** (77) And to All?h belongs the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And the command for the Hour is not but as a glance of the eye or even nearer. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**78** (78) And All?h has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing, and He made for you hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect] that perhaps you would be grateful.\n\n**79** (79) Do they not see the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except All?h. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.\n\n**8** (8) And [He created] the horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and [as] adornment. And He creates that which you do not know.\n\n**80** (80) And All?h has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment; and from their wool, fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment [i.e., provision] for a time.\n\n**81** (81) And All?h has made for you, from that which He has created, shadows [i.e., shade] and has made for you from the mountains, shelters and has made for you garments which protect you from the heat and garments [i.e., coats of mail] which protect you from your [enemy in] battle. Thus does He complete His favor upon you that you might submit [to Him].\n\n**82** (82) But if they turn away, [O Mu?ammad] - then only upon you is [responsibility for] clear notification.\n\n**83** (83) They recognize the favor of All?h; then they deny it. And most of them are disbelievers.\n\n**84** (84) And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect from every nation a witness [i.e., their prophet]. Then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers [to apologize or make excuses], nor will they be asked to appease [All?h].\n\n**85** (85) And when those who wronged see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.\n\n**86** (86) And when those who associated others with All?h see their \"partners,\" they will say, \"Our Lord, these are our partners [to You] whom we used to invoke [in worship] besides You.\" But they will throw at them the statement, \"Indeed, you are liars.\"\n\n**87** (87) And they will impart to All?h that Day [their] submission, and lost from them is what they used to invent.\n\n**88** (88) Those who disbelieved and averted [others] from the way of All?h - We will increase them in punishment over [their] punishment for what corruption they were causing.\n\n**89** (89) And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect among every nation a witness over them from themselves [i.e., their prophet]. And We will bring you, [O Mu?ammad], as a witness over these [i.e., your nation]. And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims.[711]\n\n**9** (9) And upon All?h[693] is the direction of the [right] way, and among them [i.e., the various paths] are those deviating. And if He willed, He could have guided you all.\n\n**90** (90) Indeed, All?h orders justice and good conduct and giving [help] to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded.\n\n**91** (91) And fulfill the covenant of All?h when you have taken it, [O believers], and do not break oaths after their confirmation while you have made All?h, over you, a security [i.e., witness]. Indeed, All?h knows what you do.\n\n**92** (92) And do not be like she who untwisted her spun thread after it was strong [by] taking your oaths as [means of] deceit between you because one community is more plentiful [in number or wealth] than another community.[712] All?h only tries you thereby. And He will surely make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you used to differ.\n\n**93** (93) And if All?h had willed, He could have made you [of] one religion, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills.[713] And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.\n\n**94** (94) And do not take your oaths as [means of] deceit between you, lest a foot slip after it was [once] firm, and you would taste evil [in this world] for what [people] you diverted from the way of All?h,[714] and you would have [in the Hereafter] a great punishment.\n\n**95** (95) And do not exchange the covenant of All?h for a small price. Indeed, what is with All?h is best for you, if only you could know.\n\n**96** (96) Whatever you have will end, but what All?h has is lasting. And We will surely give those who were patient their reward according to the best of what they used to do.\n\n**97** (97) Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.\n\n**98** (98) So when you recite the Qur�?n, [first] seek refuge in All?h from Satan, the expelled [from His mercy].\n\n**99** (99) Indeed, there is for him no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord."

    "content": "**1** (1) Exalted[722] is He who took His Servant [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] by night from al-Masjid al-?ar?m to al-Masjid al-Aq??,[723] whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, He is the Hearing,[724] the Seeing.[725]\n\n**10** (10) And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter - We have prepared for them a painful punishment.\n\n**100** (100) Say [to them], \"If you possessed the depositories of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold out of fear of spending.\" And ever has man been stingy.\n\n**101** (101) And We had certainly given Moses nine evident signs, so ask the Children of Israel [about] when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, \"Indeed I think, O Moses, that you are affected by magic.\"\n\n**102** (102) [Moses] said, \"You have already known that none has sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as evidence, and indeed I think,[776] O Pharaoh, that you are destroyed.\"\n\n**103** (103) So he intended to drive them from the land, but We drowned him and those with him all together.\n\n**104** (104) And We said after him [i.e., Pharaoh] to the Children of Israel, \"Dwell in the land, and when there comes the promise [i.e., appointment] of the Hereafter, We will bring you forth in [one] gathering.\"\n\n**105** (105) And with the truth We have sent it [i.e., the Qur�?n] down, and with the truth it has descended. And We have not sent you, [O Mu?ammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\n\n**106** (106) And [it is] a Qur�?n which We have separated [by intervals] that you might recite it to the people over a prolonged period. And We have sent it down progressively.\n\n**107** (107) Say, \"Believe in it or do not believe.\" Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it[777] - when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration,\n\n**108** (108) And they say, \"Exalted is our Lord! Indeed, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.\"\n\n**109** (109) And they fall upon their faces weeping, and it [i.e., the Qur�?n] increases them in humble submission.\n\n**11** (11) And man supplicates for evil [when angry] as he supplicates for good, and man is ever hasty.[730]\n\n**110** (110) Say, \"Call upon All?h or call upon the Most Merciful [ar-Ra?m?n]. Whichever [name] you call - to Him belong the best names.\" And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way.\n\n**111** (111) And say, \"Praise to All?h, who has not taken a son and has had no partner in [His] dominion and has no [need of a] protector out of weakness; and glorify Him with [great] glorification.\"\n\n**12** (12) And We have made the night and day two signs, and We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible[731] that you may seek bounty from your Lord and may know the number of years and the account [of time]. And everything We have set out in detail.\n\n**13** (13) And [for] every person We have imposed his fate upon his neck,[732] and We will produce for him on the Day of Resurrection a record which he will encounter spread open.\n\n**14** (14) [It will be said], \"Read your record. Sufficient is yourself against you this Day as accountant.\"\n\n**15** (15) Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger.\n\n**16** (16) And when We intend to destroy a city, We command its affluent[733] but they defiantly disobey therein; so the word [i.e., deserved decree] comes into effect upon it, and We destroy it with [complete] destruction.\n\n**17** (17) And how many have We destroyed from the generations after Noah. And sufficient is your Lord, concerning the sins of His servants, as Aware and Seeing.\n\n**18** (18) Whoever should desire the immediate[734] - We hasten for him from it what We will to whom We intend. Then We have made for him Hell, which he will [enter to] burn, censured and banished.\n\n**19** (19) But whoever desires the Hereafter and exerts the effort due to it while he is a believer - it is those whose effort is ever appreciated [by All?h].\n\n**2** (2) And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel that you not take other than Me as Disposer of affairs,[726]\n\n**20** (20) To each [category] We extend - to these and to those - from the gift of your Lord. And never has the gift of your Lord been restricted.\n\n**21** (21) Look how We have favored [in provision] some of them over others. But the Hereafter is greater in degrees [of difference] and greater in distinction.\n\n**22** (22) Do not make [as equal] with All?h another deity and [thereby] become censured and forsaken.\n\n**23** (23) And your Lord has decreed that you worship not except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], \"uff,\"[735] and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word.\n\n**24** (24) And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, \"My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small.\"\n\n**25** (25) Your Lord is most knowing of what is within yourselves. If you should be righteous [in intention] - then indeed He is ever, to the often returning [to Him], Forgiving.[736]\n\n**26** (26) And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully.[737]\n\n**27** (27) Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful.\n\n**28** (28) And if you [must] turn away from them [i.e., the needy] awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect,[738] then speak to them a gentle word.\n\n**29** (29) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck[739] or extend it completely[740] and [thereby] become blamed and insolvent.\n\n**3** (3) O descendants of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah. Indeed, he was a grateful servant.\n\n**30** (30) Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is ever, concerning His servants, Aware and Seeing.\n\n**31** (31) And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin.\n\n**32** (32) And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse.[741] Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way.\n\n**33** (33) And do not kill the soul [i.e., person] which All?h has forbidden, except by right.[742] And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority,[743] but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law].\n\n**34** (34) And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best,[744] until he reaches maturity. And fulfill [every] commitment. Indeed, the commitment is ever [that about which one will be] questioned.\n\n**35** (35) And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even [i.e., honest] balance. That is the best [way] and best in result.\n\n**36** (36) And do not pursue[745] that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned.\n\n**37** (37) And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height.[746]\n\n**38** (38) All that [i.e., the aforementioned] - its evil is ever, in the sight of your Lord, detested.\n\n**39** (39) That is from what your Lord has revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], of wisdom. And, [O mankind], do not make [as equal] with All?h another deity, lest you be thrown into Hell, blamed and banished.\n\n**4** (4) And We conveyed[727] to the Children of Israel in the Scripture that, \"You will surely cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach [a degree of] great haughtiness.\"\n\n**40** (40) Then, has your Lord chosen you for [having] sons and taken [i.e., adopted] from among the angels daughters? Indeed, you say a grave saying.\n\n**41** (41) And We have certainly diversified [the contents] in this Qur�?n that they [i.e., mankind] may be reminded, but it does not increase them [i.e., the disbelievers] except in aversion.\n\n**42** (42) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they say, then they [each] would have sought to the Owner of the Throne a way.\"[747]\n\n**43** (43) Exalted is He and high above what they say by great sublimity.\n\n**44** (44) The seven heavens and the earth and whatever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing except that it exalts [All?h] by His praise, but you do not understand their [way of] exalting. Indeed, He is ever Forbearing[748] and Forgiving.\n\n**45** (45) And when you recite the Qur�?n, We put between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a concealed partition.[749]\n\n**46** (46) And We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur�?n, they turn back in aversion.\n\n**47** (47) We are most knowing of how they listen to it when they listen to you and [of] when they are in private conversation, when the wrongdoers say, \"You follow not but a man affected by magic.\"\n\n**48** (48) Look how they strike for you comparisons;[750] but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way.\n\n**49** (49) And they say, \"When we are bones and crumbled particles, will we [truly] be resurrected as a new creation?\"\n\n**5** (5) So when the [time of] promise came for the first of them,[728] We sent against you servants of Ours - those of great military might, and they probed [even] into the homes,[729] and it was a promise fulfilled.\n\n**50** (50) Say, \"Be you stones or iron[751]\n\n**51** (51) Or [any] creation of that which is great[752] within your breasts.\" And they will say, \"Who will restore us?\" Say, \"He who brought you forth the first time.\" Then they will nod their heads toward you[753] and say, \"When is that?\" Say, \"Perhaps it will be soon -\n\n**52** (52) On the Day He will call you and you will respond with praise of Him and think that you had not remained [in the world] except for a little.\"\n\n**53** (53) And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces [dissension] among them. Indeed Satan is ever, to mankind, a clear enemy.\n\n**54** (54) Your Lord is most knowing of you. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you; or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you, [O Mu?ammad], over them as a manager.\n\n**55** (55) And your Lord is most knowing of whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets exceed others [in various ways], and to David We gave the book [of Psalms].\n\n**56** (56) Say, \"Invoke those you have claimed [as gods] besides Him, for they do not possess the [ability for] removal of adversity from you or [for its] transfer [to someone else].\"\n\n**57** (57) Those whom they invoke[754] seek means of access to their Lord, [striving as to] which of them would be nearest, and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is ever feared.\n\n**58** (58) And there is no city but that We will destroy it[755] before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment. That has ever been in the Register[756] inscribed.\n\n**59** (59) And nothing has prevented Us from sending signs [i.e., miracles] except that the former peoples denied them. And We gave Tham?d the she-camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her. And We send not the signs except as a warning.\n\n**6** (6) Then We gave back to you a return victory over them. And We reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower.\n\n**60** (60) And [remember, O Mu?ammad], when We told you, \"Indeed, your Lord has encompassed the people.\"[757] And We did not make the sight which We showed you[758] except as a trial for the people, as was the accursed tree [mentioned] in the Qur�?n. And We threaten [i.e., warn] them, but it increases them not except in great transgression.\n\n**61** (61) And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam,\" and they prostrated, except for Iblees.[759] He said, \"Should I prostrate to one You created from clay?\"\n\n**62** (62) [Iblees] said, \"Do You see this one whom You have honored above me? If You delay me [i.e., my death] until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely destroy[760] his descendants, except for a few.\"\n\n**63** (63) [All?h] said, \"Go, for whoever of them follows you, indeed Hell will be the recompense of [all of] you - an ample recompense.\n\n**64** (64) And incite [to senselessness] whoever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your horses and foot soldiers and become a partner in their wealth and their children and promise them.\" But Satan does not promise them except delusion.\n\n**65** (65) Indeed, over My [believing] servants there is for you no authority. And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs.[761]\n\n**66** (66) It is your Lord who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Indeed, He is ever, to you, Merciful.\n\n**67** (67) And when adversity touches you at sea, lost are [all] those you invoke except for Him. But when He delivers you to the land, you turn away [from Him]. And ever is man ungrateful.\n\n**68** (68) Then do you feel secure that [instead] He will not cause a part of the land to swallow you or send against you a storm of stones? Then you would not find for yourselves an advocate.\n\n**69** (69) Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back into it [i.e., the sea] another time and send upon you a hurricane of wind and drown you for what you denied?[762] Then you would not find for yourselves against Us an avenger.[763]\n\n**7** (7) [And said], \"If you do good, you do good for yourselves; and if you do evil, [you do it] to them [i.e., yourselves].\" Then when the final [i.e., second] promise came, [We sent your enemies] to sadden your faces and to enter the masjid [i.e., the temple in Jerusalem], as they entered it the first time, and to destroy what they had taken over with [total] destruction.\n\n**70** (70) And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.\n\n**71** (71) [Mention, O Mu?ammad], the Day We will call forth every people with their record [of deeds].[764] Then whoever is given his record in his right hand - those will read their records, and injustice will not be done to them, [even] as much as a thread [inside the date seed].\n\n**72** (72) And whoever is blind[765] in this [life] will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray in way.\n\n**73** (73) And indeed, they were about to tempt you away from that which We revealed to you in order to [make] you invent about Us something else; and then they would have taken you as a friend.\n\n**74** (74) And if We had not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little.\n\n**75** (75) Then [if you had], We would have made you taste double [punishment in] life and double [after] death. Then you would not find for yourself against Us a helper.\n\n**76** (76) And indeed, they were about to provoke [i.e., drive] you from the land [i.e., Makkah] to evict you therefrom. And then [when they do], they will not remain [there] after you, except for a little.[766]\n\n**77** (77) [That is Our] established way for those We had sent before you of Our messengers; and you will not find in Our way any alteration.\n\n**78** (78) Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night[767] and [also] the Qur�?n [i.e., recitation] of dawn.[768] Indeed, the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed.\n\n**79** (79) And from [part of] the night, pray[769] with it [i.e., recitation of the Qur�?n] as additional [worship] for you; it is expected that[770] your Lord will resurrect you to a praised station.[771]\n\n**8** (8) [Then All?h said], \"It is expected, [if you repent], that your Lord will have mercy upon you. But if you return [to sin], We will return [to punishment]. And We have made Hell, for the disbelievers, a prison-bed.\"\n\n**80** (80) And say, \"My Lord, cause me to enter a sound entrance[772] and to exit a sound exit[773] and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority.\"\n\n**81** (81) And say, \"Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart.\"\n\n**82** (82) And We send down of the Qur�?n that which is healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.\n\n**83** (83) And when We bestow favor upon man [i.e., the disbeliever], he turns away and distances himself; and when evil touches him, he is ever despairing.\n\n**84** (84) Say, \"Each works according to his manner, but your Lord is most knowing of who is best guided in way.\"\n\n**85** (85) And they ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about the soul. Say, \"The soul is of the affair [i.e., concern] of my Lord. And you [i.e., mankind] have not been given of knowledge except a little.\"\n\n**86** (86) And if We willed, We could surely do away with that which We revealed to you. Then you would not find for yourself concerning it an advocate against Us.\n\n**87** (87) Except [We have left it with you] as a mercy from your Lord. Indeed, His favor upon you has ever been great.\n\n**88** (88) Say, \"If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur�?n, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants.\"\n\n**89** (89) And We have certainly diversified for the people in this Qur�?n from every [kind of] example, but most of the people refused except disbelief.\n\n**9** (9) Indeed, this Qur�?n guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward\n\n**90** (90) And they say, \"We will not believe you until you break open for us from the ground a spring\n\n**91** (91) Or [until] you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and make rivers gush forth within them in force [and abundance]\n\n**92** (92) Or you make the heaven fall upon us in fragments as you have claimed or you bring All?h and the angels before [us]\n\n**93** (93) Or you have a house of ornament [i.e., gold] or you ascend into the sky. And [even then], we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book we may read.\" Say, \"Exalted is my Lord! Was I ever but a human messenger?\"\n\n**94** (94) And what prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, \"Has All?h sent a human messenger?\"\n\n**95** (95) Say, \"If there were upon the earth angels walking securely,[774] We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel [as a] messenger.\"\n\n**96** (96) Say, \"Sufficient is All?h as Witness between me and you. Indeed He is ever, concerning His servants, Aware and Seeing.\"\n\n**97** (97) And whoever All?h guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray[775] - you will never find for them protectors besides Him, and We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection [fallen] on their faces - blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell; every time it subsides, We increase [for] them blazing fire.\n\n**98** (98) That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our verses and said, \"When we are bones and crumbled particles, will we [truly] be resurrected [in] a new creation?\"\n\n**99** (99) Do they not see that All?h, who created the heavens and earth, is [the one] Able to create the likes of them? And He has appointed for them a term, about which there is no doubt. But the wrongdoers refuse except disbelief."

Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging.\n\n**103** (103) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Shall we [believers] inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds?\n\n**104** (104) [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work.\"\n\n**105** (105) Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in [their] meeting Him, so their deeds have become worthless; and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight [i.e., importance].\n\n**106** (106) That is their recompense - Hell - for what they denied and [because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicule.\n\n**107** (107) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - they will have the Gardens of Paradise[803] as a lodging,\n\n**108** (108) Wherein they abide eternally. They will not desire from it any transfer.\n\n**109** (109) Say, \"If the sea were ink for [writing] the words[804] of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it in [continual] supplement.\"\n\n**11** (11) So We cast [a cover of sleep] over their ears within the cave for a number of years.\n\n**110** (110) Say, \"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.\"\n\n**12** (12) Then We awakened them that We might show which of the two factions was most precise in calculating what [extent] they had remained in time.\n\n**13** (13) It is We who relate to you, [O Mu?ammad], their story in truth. Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.\n\n**14** (14) And We bound [i.e., made firm] their hearts when they stood up and said, \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken, then, an excessive transgression.\n\n**15** (15) These, our people, have taken besides Him deities. Why do they not bring for [worship of] them a clear evidence? And who is more unjust than one who invents about All?h a lie?\"\n\n**16** (16) [The youths said to one another], \"And when you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship other than All?h, retreat to the cave. Your Lord will spread out for you of His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair facility.\"\n\n**17** (17) And [had you been present], you would see the sun when it rose, inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, passing away from them on the left, while they were [lying] within an open space thereof. That was from the signs of All?h. He whom All?h guides is the [rightly] guided, but he whom He sends astray - never will you find for him a protecting guide.\n\n**18** (18) And you would think them awake, while they were asleep. And We turned them to the right and to the left, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned from them in flight and been filled by them with terror.\n\n**19** (19) And similarly,[782] We awakened them that they might question one another. Said a speaker from among them, \"How long have you remained [here]?\" They said, \"We have remained a day or part of a day.\" They said, \"Your Lord is most knowing of how long you remained. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city and let him look to which is the best of food and bring you provision from it and let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you.\n\n**2** (2) [He has made it] straight, to warn of severe punishment from Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward [i.e., Paradise]\n\n**20** (20) Indeed, if they come to know of you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. And never would you succeed, then - ever.\"\n\n**21** (21) And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of All?h is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they[783] disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, \"Construct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them.\" Said those who prevailed in the matter, \"We will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid.\"[784]\n\n**22** (22) They [i.e., people] will say there were three, the fourth of them being their dog; and they will say there were five, the sixth of them being their dog - guessing at the unseen; and they will say there were seven, and the eighth of them was their dog. Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few. So do not argue about them except with an obvious argument[785] and do not inquire about them among [the speculators] from anyone.\"\n\n**23** (23) And never say of anything, \"Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,\"\n\n**24** (24) Except [when adding], \"If All?h wills.\" And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct.\"\n\n**25** (25) And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and exceeded by nine.[786]\n\n**26** (26) Say, \"All?h is most knowing of how long they remained. He has [knowledge of] the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. How Seeing is He and how Hearing! They have not besides Him any protector, and He shares not His legislation with anyone.\"\n\n**27** (27) And recite, [O Mu?ammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changer of His words, and never will you find in other than Him a refuge.\n\n**28** (28) And keep yourself patient [by being] with those who call upon their Lord in the morning and the evening, seeking His face [i.e., acceptance]. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever [in] neglect.[787]\n\n**29** (29) And say, \"The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.\" Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.\n\n**3** (3) In which they will remain forever\n\n**30** (30) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - indeed, We will not allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds.\n\n**31** (31) Those will have gardens of perpetual residence; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, reclining therein on adorned couches. Excellent is the reward, and good is the resting place.\n\n**32** (32) And present to them an example of two men: We granted to one of them two gardens of grapevines, and We bordered them with palm trees and placed between them [fields of] crops.\n\n**33** (33) Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything. And We caused to gush forth within them a river.\n\n**34** (34) And he had fruit, so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him, \"I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in [numbers of] men.\"\n\n**35** (35) And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself.[788] He said, \"I do not think that this will perish - ever.\n\n**36** (36) And I do not think the Hour will occur. And even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely find better than this as a return.\"\n\n**37** (37) His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, \"Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust and then from a sperm-drop and then proportioned you [as] a man?\n\n**38** (38) But as for me, He is All?h, my Lord, and I do not associate with my Lord anyone.\n\n**39** (39) And why did you, when you entered your garden, not say, 'What All?h willed [has occurred]; there is no power except in All?h'? Although you see me less than you in wealth and children,\n\n**4** (4) And to warn those who say, \"All?h has taken a son.\"\n\n**40** (40) It may be that my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden and will send upon it a [disastrous] penalty from the sky, and it will become a smooth, dusty ground,\n\n**41** (41) Or its water will become sunken [into the earth], so you would never be able to seek it.\"\n\n**42** (42) And his fruits were encompassed [by ruin], so he began to turn his hands about [in dismay] over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises, and said, \"Oh, I wish I had not associated with my Lord anyone.\"[789]\n\n**43** (43) And there was for him no company to aid him other than All?h, nor could he defend himself.\n\n**44** (44) There[790] the authority is [completely] for All?h, the Truth. He is best in reward and best in outcome.\n\n**45** (45) And present to them the example of the life of this world, [its being] like rain which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it[791] and [then] it becomes dry remnants, scattered by the winds. And All?h is ever, over all things, Perfect in Ability.\n\n**46** (46) Wealth and children are [but] adornment of the worldly life. But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord[792] for reward and better for [one's] hope.\n\n**47** (47) And [warn of] the Day when We will remove the mountains and you will see the earth exposed,[793] and We will gather them and not leave behind from them anyone.\n\n**48** (48) And they will be presented before your Lord in rows, [and He will say], \"You have certainly come to Us just as We created you the first time. But you claimed that We would never make for you an appointment.\"\n\n**49** (49) And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, \"Oh, woe to us! What is this book that leaves nothing small or great except that it has enumerated it?\" And they will find what they did present [before them]. And your Lord does injustice to no one.\n\n**5** (5) They have no knowledge of it,[780] nor had their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths; they speak not except a lie.\n\n**50** (50) And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam,\" and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from [i.e., disobeyed] the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.\n\n**51** (51) I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves, and I would not have taken the misguiders as assistants.\n\n**52** (52) And [warn of] the Day when He will say, \"Call My 'partners' whom you claimed,\" and they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them. And We will put between them [a valley of] destruction.\n\n**53** (53) And the criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they are to fall therein. And they will not find from it a way elsewhere.\n\n**54** (54) And We have certainly diversified in this Qur�?n for the people from every [kind of] example; but man has ever been, most of anything, [prone to] dispute.\n\n**55** (55) And nothing has prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that there [must] befall them the [accustomed] precedent of the former peoples[794] or that the punishment should come [directly] before them.\n\n**56** (56) And We send not the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. And those who disbelieve dispute by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth and have taken My verses, and that of which they are warned, in ridicule.\n\n**57** (57) And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if you invite them to guidance - they will never be guided, then - ever.\n\n**58** (58) And your Lord is the Forgiving, the possessor of mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointment from which they will never find an escape.\n\n**59** (59) And those cities - We destroyed them when they wronged, and We made for their destruction an appointed time.\n\n**6** (6) Then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, [O Mu?ammad], if they do not believe in this message, [and] out of sorrow.\n\n**60** (60) And [mention] when Moses said to his boy [i.e., servant], \"I will not cease [traveling] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period.\"\n\n**61** (61) But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot their fish, and it took its course into the sea, slipping away.\n\n**62** (62) So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, \"Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, [much] fatigue.\"\n\n**63** (63) He said, \"Did you see when we retired to the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. And none made me forget it except Satan - that I should mention it. And it took its course into the sea amazingly.\"\n\n**64** (64) [Moses] said, \"That is what we were seeking.\" So they returned, following their footprints.\n\n**65** (65) And they found a servant from among Our servants [i.e., al-Khi?r] to whom We had given mercy from Us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge.\n\n**66** (66) Moses said to him, \"May I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?\"\n\n**67** (67) He said, \"Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience.\n\n**68** (68) And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?\"\n\n**69** (69) [Moses] said, \"You will find me, if All?h wills, patient, and I will not disobey you in [any] order.\"\n\n**7** (7) Indeed, We have made that which is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them [as to] which of them is best in deed.\n\n**70** (70) He said, \"Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make to you about it mention [i.e., explanation].\"\n\n**71** (71) So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, he [i.e., al-Khi?r] tore it open. [Moses] said, \"Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing.\"\n\n**72** (72) [Al-Khi?r] said, \"Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?\"\n\n**73** (73) [Moses] said, \"Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not overwhelm me in my matter with difficulty.\"\n\n**74** (74) So they set out, until when they met a boy, he [i.e., al-Khi?r] killed him. [Moses] said, \"Have you killed a pure soul for other than [having killed] a soul? You have certainly done a deplorable thing.\"\n\n**75** (75) [Al-Khi?r] said, \"Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?\"\n\n**76** (76) [Moses] said, \"If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse.\"\n\n**77** (77) So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so he [i.e., al-Khi?r] restored it. [Moses] said, \"If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment.\"\n\n**78** (78) [Al-Khi?r] said, \"This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.\n\n**79** (79) As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force.\n\n**8** (8) And indeed, We will make that which is upon it [into] a barren ground.\n\n**80** (80) And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief.\n\n**81** (81) So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy.\n\n**82** (82) And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience.\"\n\n**83** (83) And they ask you, [O Mu?ammad], about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, \"I will recite to you about him a report.\"\n\n**84** (84) Indeed, We established him upon the earth, and We gave him from everything a way [i.e., means].\n\n**85** (85) So he followed a way\n\n**86** (86) Until, when he reached the setting of the sun [i.e., the west], he found it [as if] setting in a body of dark water,[795] and he found near it a people. We [i.e., All?h] said, \"O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you punish [them] or else adopt among them [a way of] goodness.\"\n\n**87** (87) He said, \"As for one who wrongs,[796] we will punish him. Then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a terrible punishment [i.e., Hellfire].\n\n**88** (88) But as for one who believes and does righteousness, he will have a reward of the best [i.e., Paradise], and we [i.e., Dhul-Qarnayn] will speak to him from our command with ease.\"\n\n**89** (89) Then he followed a way\n\n**9** (9) Or have you thought that the companions of the cave and the inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder?[781]\n\n**90** (90) Until, when he came to the rising of the sun [i.e., the east], he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against it any shield.\n\n**91** (91) Thus.[797] And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.\n\n**92** (92) Then he followed a way\n\n**93** (93) Until, when he reached [a pass] between two mountains, he found beside them a people who could hardly understand [his] speech.\n\n**94** (94) They said, \"O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog[798] are [great] corrupters in the land. So may we assign for you an expenditure that you might make between us and them a barrier?\"\n\n**95** (95) He said, \"That in which my Lord has established me is better [than what you offer], but assist me with strength [i.e., manpower]; I will make between you and them a dam.\n\n**96** (96) Bring me bars of iron\" - until, when he had leveled [them] between the two mountain walls, he said, \"Blow [with bellows],\" until when he had made it [like] fire, he said, \"Bring me, that I may pour over it molten copper.\"\n\n**97** (97) So they [i.e., Gog and Magog] were unable to pass over it, nor were they able [to effect] in it any penetration.\n\n**98** (98) [Dhul-Qarnayn] said, \"This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord[799] comes [i.e., approaches], He will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true.\"\n\n**99** (99) And We will leave them that day[800] surging over each other, and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will assemble them in [one] assembly."

Then We sent to her Our Angel [i.e., Gabriel], and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man.\n\n**18** (18) She said, \"Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of All?h.\"\n\n**19** (19) He said, \"I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you [news of] a pure boy [i.e., son].\"\n\n**2** (2) [This is] a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah\n\n**20** (20) She said, \"How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?\"\n\n**21** (21) He said, \"Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'\"\n\n**22** (22) So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.\n\n**23** (23) And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten.\"\n\n**24** (24) But he[812] called her from below her, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream.\n\n**25** (25) And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates.\n\n**26** (26) So eat and drink and be contented. And if you see from among humanity anyone, say, 'Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful abstention, so I will not speak today to [any] man.'\"\n\n**27** (27) Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, \"O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented.\n\n**28** (28) O sister [i.e., descendant] of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\"\n\n**29** (29) So she pointed to him. They said, \"How can we speak to one who is in the cradle a child?\"\n\n**3** (3) When he called to his Lord a private call [i.e., supplication].\n\n**30** (30) [Jesus] said, \"Indeed, I am the servant of All?h. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.\n\n**31** (31) And He has made me blessed wherever I am and has enjoined upon me prayer and zak?h as long as I remain alive\n\n**32** (32) And [made me] dutiful to my mother, and He has not made me a wretched tyrant.\n\n**33** (33) And peace is on me the day I was born and the day I will die and the day I am raised alive.\"\n\n**34** (34) That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the word of truth about which they are in dispute.\n\n**35** (35) It is not [befitting] for All?h to take a son; exalted is He![813] When He decrees an affair, He only says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n**36** (36) [Jesus said], \"And indeed, All?h is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path.\"\n\n**37** (37) Then the factions differed [concerning Jesus] from among them, so woe to those who disbelieved - from the scene of a tremendous Day.\n\n**38** (38) How [clearly] they will hear and see the Day they come to Us, but the wrongdoers today are in clear error.\n\n**39** (39) And warn them, [O Mu?ammad], of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded;[814] and [yet], they are in [a state of] heedlessness, and they do not believe.\n\n**4** (4) He said, \"My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has filled[807] with white, and never have I been in my supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy [i.e., disappointed].\n\n**40** (40) Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned.\n\n**41** (41) And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.\n\n**42** (42) [Mention] when he said to his father, \"O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all?\n\n**43** (43) O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path.\n\n**44** (44) O my father, do not worship [i.e., obey] Satan. Indeed Satan has ever been, to the Most Merciful, disobedient.\n\n**45** (45) O my father, indeed I fear that there will touch you a punishment from the Most Merciful so you would be to Satan a companion [in Hellfire].\"\n\n**46** (46) [His father] said, \"Have you no desire for my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, so avoid me a prolonged time.\"\n\n**47** (47) [Abraham] said, \"Peace [i.e., safety] will be upon you.[815] I will ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Indeed, He is ever gracious to me.\n\n**48** (48) And I will leave you and those you invoke other than All?h and will invoke[816] my Lord. I expect that I will not be in invocation to my Lord unhappy [i.e., disappointed].\"\n\n**49** (49) So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than All?h, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet.\n\n**5** (5) And indeed, I fear the successors[808] after me, and my wife has been barren, so give me from Yourself an heir\n\n**50** (50) And We gave them of Our mercy, and We made for them a mention [i.e., reputation] of high honor.\n\n**51** (51) And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet.[817]\n\n**52** (52) And We called him from the side of the mount[818] at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him].\n\n**53** (53) And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet.\n\n**54** (54) And mention in the Book, Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet.\n\n**55** (55) And he used to enjoin on his people prayer and zak?h and was to his Lord pleasing [i.e., accepted by Him].\n\n**56** (56) And mention in the Book, Idrees. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet.\n\n**57** (57) And We raised him to a high station.\n\n**58** (58) Those were the ones upon whom All?h bestowed favor from among the prophets of the descendants of Adam and of those We carried [in the ship] with Noah, and of the descendants of Abraham and Israel [i.e., Jacob], and of those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell in prostration and weeping.\n\n**59** (59) But there came after them successors [i.e., later generations] who neglected prayer and pursued desires; so they are going to meet evil[819] -\n\n**6** (6) Who will inherit me[809] and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You].\"\n\n**60** (60) Except those who repent, believe and do righteousness; for those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged at all.\n\n**61** (61) [Therein are] gardens of perpetual residence which the Most Merciful has promised His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise has ever been eminent.[820]\n\n**62** (62) They will not hear therein any ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and they will have their provision therein, morning and afternoon.\n\n**63** (63) That is Paradise, which We give as inheritance to those of Our servants who were fearing of All?h.\n\n**64** (64) [Gabriel said],[821] \"And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful -\n\n**65** (65) Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and have patience for His worship. Do you know of any similarity to Him?\"\n\n**66** (66) And man [i.e., the disbeliever] says, \"When I have died, am I going to be brought forth alive?\"\n\n**67** (67) Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing?\n\n**68** (68) So by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will bring them to be present around Hell upon their knees.[822]\n\n**69** (69) Then We will surely extract from every sect those of them who were worst against the Most Merciful in insolence.\n\n**7** (7) [He was told],[810] \"O Zechariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be John. We have not assigned to any before [this] name.\"\n\n**70** (70) Then, surely it is We who are most knowing of those most worthy of burning therein.\n\n**71** (71) And there is none of you except he will come to it.[823] This is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed.\n\n**72** (72) Then We will save those who feared All?h and leave the wrongdoers within it, on their knees.\n\n**73** (73) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Which of [our] two parties is best in position and best in association?\"[824]\n\n**74** (74) And how many a generation have We destroyed before them who were better in possessions and [outward] appearance?\n\n**75** (75) Say, \"Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend for him an extension [in wealth and time] until, when they see that which they were promised - either punishment [in this world] or the Hour [of resurrection] - they will come to know who is worst in position and weaker in soldiers.\"\n\n**76** (76) And All?h increases those who were guided, in guidance, and the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord[825] for reward and better for recourse.\n\n**77** (77) Then, have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, \"I will surely be given wealth and children [in the next life]\"?\n\n**78** (78) Has he looked into the unseen, or has he taken from the Most Merciful a promise?\n\n**79** (79) No! We will record what he says and extend [i.e., increase] for him from the punishment extensively.\n\n**8** (8) He said, \"My Lord, how will I have a boy when my wife has been barren and I have reached extreme old age?\"\n\n**80** (80) And We will inherit him [in] what he mentions,[826] and he will come to Us alone.\n\n**81** (81) And they have taken besides All?h [false] deities that they would be for them [a source of] honor.\n\n**82** (82) No! They [i.e., those \"gods\"] will deny their worship of them and will be against them opponents [on the Day of Judgement].\n\n**83** (83) Do you not see that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them [to evil] with [constant] incitement?\n\n**84** (84) So be not impatient over them. We only count out [i.e., allow] to them a [limited] number.[827]\n\n**85** (85) On the Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation\n\n**86** (86) And will drive the criminals to Hell in thirst\n\n**87** (87) None will have [power of] intercession except he who had taken from the Most Merciful a covenant.[828]\n\n**88** (88) And they say, \"The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son.\"\n\n**89** (89) You have done an atrocious thing.\n\n**9** (9) [An angel] said, \"Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, for I created you before, while you were nothing.'\"\n\n**90** (90) The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation\n\n**91** (91) That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son.\n\n**92** (92) And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son.\n\n**93** (93) There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant.\n\n**94** (94) He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting.\n\n**95** (95) And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.\n\n**96** (96) Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection.[829]\n\n**97** (97) So, [O Mu?ammad], We have only made it [i.e., the Qur�?n] easy in your tongue [i.e., the Arabic language] that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people.\n\n**98** (98) And how many have We destroyed before them of generations? Do you perceive of them anyone or hear from them a sound?"

And We will gather the criminals, that Day, blue-eyed.[854]\n\n**103** (103) They will murmur among themselves, \"You remained not but ten [days in the world].\"\n\n**104** (104) We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in manner [i.e., wisdom or speech] will say, \"You remained not but one day.\"\n\n**105** (105) And they ask you about the mountains, so say, \"My Lord will blow them away with a blast.[855]\n\n**106** (106) And He will leave it [i.e., the earth] a level plain;\n\n**107** (107) You will not see therein a depression or an elevation.\"\n\n**108** (108) That Day, they [i.e., everyone] will follow [the call of] the Caller[856] [with] no deviation therefrom, and [all] voices will be stilled before the Most Merciful, so you will not hear except a whisper [of footsteps].\n\n**109** (109) That Day, no intercession will benefit except [that of] one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and has accepted his word.\n\n**11** (11) And when he came to it, he was called, \"O Moses,\n\n**110** (110) He [i.e., All?h] knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[857] but they do not encompass it [i.e., what He knows] in knowledge.\n\n**111** (111) And [all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.[858] And he will have failed who carries injustice.[859]\n\n**112** (112) But he who does of righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will neither fear injustice nor deprivation.\n\n**113** (113) And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur�?n[860] and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will avoid [sin] or it would cause them remembrance.\n\n**114** (114) So high [above all] is All?h, the Sovereign,[861] the Truth.[862] And, [O Mu?ammad], do not hasten with [recitation of] the Qur�?n before its revelation is completed to you, and say, \"My Lord, increase me in knowledge.\"\n\n**115** (115) And We had already taken a promise from Adam before, but he forgot; and We found not in him determination.[863]\n\n**116** (116) And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam,\" and they prostrated, except Iblees;[864] he refused.\n\n**117** (117) So We said, \"O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.\n\n**118** (118) Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed.\n\n**119** (119) And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot from the sun.\"\n\n**12** (12) Indeed, I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the blessed valley of ?uw?.\n\n**120** (120) Then Satan whispered to him; he said, \"O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?\"\n\n**121** (121) And they [i.e., Adam and his wife] ate of it, and their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and erred.\n\n**122** (122) Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him].\n\n**123** (123) [All?h] said, \"Descend from it [i.e., Paradise] - all, [your descendants] being enemies to one another. And if there should come to you guidance from Me - then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in the world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter].\n\n**124** (124) And whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed [i.e., difficult] life, and We will gather [i.e., raise] him on the Day of Resurrection blind.\"\n\n**125** (125) He will say, \"My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I was [once] seeing?\"\n\n**126** (126) [All?h] will say, \"Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot [i.e., disregarded] them; and thus will you this Day be forgotten.\"\n\n**127** (127) And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring.[865]\n\n**128** (128) Then, has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them as they walk among their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.\n\n**129** (129) And if not for a word[866] that preceded from your Lord, it [i.e., punishment] would have been an obligation [due immediately],[867] and [if not for] a specified term [decreed].\n\n**13** (13) And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you].\n\n**130** (130) So be patient over what they say and exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and during periods of the night [exalt Him] and at the ends of the day, that you may be satisfied.\n\n**131** (131) And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.\n\n**132** (132) And enjoin prayer upon your family [and people] and be steadfast therein. We ask you not for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for [those of] righteousness.\n\n**133** (133) And they say, \"Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?\" Has there not come to them evidence of what was in the former scriptures?[868]\n\n**134** (134) And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him,[869] they would have said, \"Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses [i.e., teachings] before we were humiliated and disgraced?\"\n\n**135** (135) Say, \"Each [of us] is waiting;[870] so wait. For you will know who are the companions of the sound path and who is guided.\"\n\n**14** (14) Indeed, I am All?h. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance.\n\n**15** (15) Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it[833] - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives.\n\n**16** (16) So do not let one avert you from it[834] who does not believe in it and follows his desire, for you [then] would perish.\n\n**17** (17) And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?\"\n\n**18** (18) He said, \"It is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves for my sheep and I have therein other uses.\"\n\n**19** (19) [All?h] said, \"Throw it down, O Moses.\"\n\n**2** (2) We have not sent down to you the Qur�?n that you be distressed\n\n**20** (20) So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a snake, moving swiftly.\n\n**21** (21) [All?h] said, \"Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its former condition.\n\n**22** (22) And draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white without disease - another sign,\n\n**23** (23) That We may show you [some] of Our greater signs.\n\n**24** (24) Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed [i.e., tyrannized].\"\n\n**25** (25) [Moses] said, \"My Lord, expand [i.e., relax] for me my breast [with assurance]\n\n**26** (26) And ease for me my task\n\n**27** (27) And untie the knot from my tongue\n\n**28** (28) That they may understand my speech.\n\n**29** (29) And appoint for me a minister [i.e., assistant] from my family -\n\n**3** (3) But only as a reminder for those who fear [All?h] -\n\n**30** (30) Aaron, my brother.\n\n**31** (31) Increase through him my strength\n\n**32** (32) And let him share my task\n\n**33** (33) That we may exalt You much\n\n**34** (34) And remember You much.\n\n**35** (35) Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing.\"\n\n**36** (36) [All?h] said, \"You have been granted your request, O Moses.\n\n**37** (37) And We had already conferred favor upon you another time,\n\n**38** (38) When We inspired to your mother what We inspired,\n\n**39** (39) [Saying], 'Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me[835] that you would be brought up under My eye [i.e., observation and care].\n\n**4** (4) A revelation from He who created the earth and highest heavens,\n\n**40** (40) [And We favored you] when your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?' So We restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. And you killed someone,[836] but We saved you from retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial. And you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses.\n\n**41** (41) And I produced you for Myself.[837]\n\n**42** (42) Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in My remembrance.\n\n**43** (43) Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.\n\n**44** (44) And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [All?h].\"\n\n**45** (45) They said, \"Our Lord, indeed we are afraid that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress.\"\n\n**46** (46) [All?h] said, \"Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see.\n\n**47** (47) So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace[838] will be upon he who follows the guidance.\n\n**48** (48) Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away.'\"\n\n**49** (49) [Pharaoh] said, \"So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?\"\n\n**5** (5) The Most Merciful [who is] above the Throne established.[832]\n\n**50** (50) He said, \"Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it].\"\n\n**51** (51) [Pharaoh] said, \"Then what is the case of the former generations?\"\n\n**52** (52) [Moses] said, \"The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.\"\n\n**53** (53) [It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants.\n\n**54** (54) Eat [therefrom] and pasture your livestock. Indeed in that are signs for those of intelligence.\n\n**55** (55) From it [i.e., the earth] We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time.\n\n**56** (56) And We certainly showed him [i.e., Pharaoh] Our signs - all of them - but he denied and refused.\n\n**57** (57) He said, \"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?\n\n**58** (58) Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned.\"[839]\n\n**59** (59) [Moses] said, \"Your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid-morning.\"[840]\n\n**6** (6) To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth and what is between them and what is under the soil.\n\n**60** (60) So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came [to Moses].\n\n**61** (61) Moses said to them [i.e., the magicians summoned by Pharaoh], \"Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against All?h or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who invents [such falsehood].\"\n\n**62** (62) So they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation.\n\n**63** (63) They said, \"Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way [i.e., religion or tradition].\n\n**64** (64) So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. And he has succeeded today who overcomes.\"\n\n**65** (65) They said, \"O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw.\"\n\n**66** (66) He said, \"Rather, you throw.\" And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes].\n\n**67** (67) And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses.\n\n**68** (68) We [i.e., All?h] said, \"Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior.\n\n**69** (69) And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is.\"\n\n**7** (7) And if you speak aloud - then indeed, He knows the secret and what is [even] more hidden.\n\n**70** (70) So the magicians fell down in prostration.[841] They said, \"We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.\"\n\n**71** (71) [Pharaoh] said, \"You believed him [i.e., Moses] before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more enduring.\"\n\n**72** (72) They said, \"Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us.[842] So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life.\n\n**73** (73) Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And All?h is better and more enduring.\"[843]\n\n**74** (74) Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live.\n\n**75** (75) But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds - for those will be the highest degrees [in position]:\n\n**76** (76) Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of one who purifies himself.[844]\n\n**77** (77) And We had inspired to Moses, \"Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning].\"\n\n**78** (78) So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them,[845]\n\n**79** (79) And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them].\n\n**8** (8) All?h - there is no deity except Him. To Him belong the best names.\n\n**80** (80) O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made an appointment with you[846] at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails,\n\n**81** (81) [Saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. And he upon whom My anger descends has certainly fallen [i.e., perished].\"\n\n**82** (82) But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\n\n**83** (83) [All?h said], \"And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses?\"\n\n**84** (84) He said, \"They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased.\"\n\n**85** (85) [All?h] said, \"But indeed, We have tried your people after you [departed], and the S?mir?[847] has led them astray.\"\n\n**86** (86) So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved.[848] He said, \"O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise?[849] Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord descend upon you, so you broke your promise [of obedience] to me?\"\n\n**87** (87) They said, \"We did not break our promise to you by our will, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the S?mir? throw.\"\n\n**88** (88) And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a lowing sound, and they said, \"This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot.\"\n\n**89** (89) Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech [i.e., response] and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit?\n\n**9** (9) And has the story of Moses reached you? -\n\n**90** (90) And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], \"O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order.\"\n\n**91** (91) They said, \"We will never cease being devoted to it [i.e., the calf] until Moses returns to us.\"\n\n**92** (92) [Moses] said, \"O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,\n\n**93** (93) From following me? Then have you disobeyed my order?\"\n\n**94** (94) [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not observe [or await] my word.'\"\n\n**95** (95) [Moses] said, \"And what is your case, O S?mir??\"\n\n**96** (96) He said, \"I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger[850] and threw it,[851] and thus did my soul entice me.\"\n\n**97** (97) [Moses] said, \"Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.'[852] And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your 'god' to which you remained devoted. We will surely burn it and blow it [i.e., its ashes] into the sea with a blast.\n\n**98** (98) Your god is only All?h, except for whom there is no deity. He has encompassed all things in knowledge.\"\n\n**99** (99) Thus, [O Mu?ammad], We relate to you from the news of what has preceded. And We have certainly given you from Us a message [i.e., the Qur�?n]."

And our Lord is the Most Merciful, the one whose help is sought against that which you describe.\"[913]\n\n**12** (12) And when they [i.e., its inhabitants] perceived Our punishment, at once they fled from it.\n\n**13** (13) [Some angels said], \"Do not flee but return to where you were given luxury and to your homes - perhaps you will be questioned.\"[877]\n\n**14** (14) They said, \"O woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers.\"\n\n**15** (15) And that declaration of theirs did not cease until We made them [as] a harvest [mowed down], extinguished [like a fire].\n\n**16** (16) And We did not create the heaven and earth and that between them in play.\n\n**17** (17) Had We intended to take a diversion,[878] We could have taken it from [what is] with Us - if [indeed] We were to do so.\n\n**18** (18) Rather, We dash the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it,[879] and thereupon it departs. And for you is destruction from that which you describe.[880]\n\n**19** (19) To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those near Him [i.e., the angels] are not prevented by arrogance from His worship, nor do they tire.\n\n**2** (2) No mention [i.e., revelation] comes to them anew from their Lord except that they listen to it while they are at play\n\n**20** (20) They exalt [Him] night and day [and] do not slacken.\n\n**21** (21) Or have they [i.e., men] taken for themselves gods from the earth who resurrect [the dead]?\n\n**22** (22) Had there been within them [i.e., the heavens and earth] gods besides All?h, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is All?h, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.\n\n**23** (23) He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.\n\n**24** (24) Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Produce your proof. This [Qur�?n] is the message for those with me and the message of those before me.\"[881] But most of them do not know the truth, so they are turning away.\n\n**25** (25) And We sent not before you any messenger except We revealed to him that, \"There is no deity except Me, so worship Me.\"\n\n**26** (26) And they say, \"The Most Merciful has taken a son.\" Exalted is He! Rather, they[882] are [but] honored servants.\n\n**27** (27) They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command.\n\n**28** (28) He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them,[883] and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves. And they, from fear of Him, are apprehensive.\n\n**29** (29) And whoever of them should say, \"Indeed, I am a god besides Him\" - that one We would recompense with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.\n\n**3** (3) With their hearts distracted. And those who do wrong conceal their private conversation, [saying], \"Is this [Prophet] except a human being like you? So would you approach magic while you are aware [of it]?\"\n\n**30** (30) Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and then We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?\n\n**31** (31) And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We made therein [mountain] passes [as] roads that they might be guided.\n\n**32** (32) And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs,[884] are turning away.\n\n**33** (33) And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming.\n\n**34** (34) And We did not grant to any man before you eternity [on earth]; so if you die - would they be eternal?\n\n**35** (35) Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned.\n\n**36** (36) And when those who disbelieve see you, [O Mu?ammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], \"Is this the one who mentions [i.e., insults] your gods?\" And they are, at the mention of the Most Merciful, disbelievers.\n\n**37** (37) Man was created of haste [i.e., impatience]. I will show you My signs [i.e., vengeance], so do not impatiently urge Me.\n\n**38** (38) And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**39** (39) If those who disbelieved but knew the time when they will not avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs and they will not be aided...[885]\n\n**4** (4) He [the Prophet (?)] said, \"My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\"\n\n**40** (40) Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved.\n\n**41** (41) And already were messengers ridiculed before you, but those who mocked them were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**42** (42) Say, \"Who can protect you at night or by day from the Most Merciful?\" But they are, from the remembrance of their Lord, turning away.\n\n**43** (43) Or do they have gods to defend them other than Us? They are unable [even] to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us.\n\n**44** (44) But, [on the contrary], We have provided good things for these [disbelievers] and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. Then do they not see that We set upon the land, reducing it from its borders?[886] Is it they who will overcome?\n\n**45** (45) Say, \"I only warn you by revelation.\" But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned.\n\n**46** (46) And if [as much as] a whiff of the punishment of your Lord should touch them, they would surely say, \"O woe to us! Indeed, we have been wrongdoers.\"\n\n**47** (47) And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly at all. And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed,[887] We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant.\n\n**48** (48) And We had already given Moses and Aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder[888] for the righteous\n\n**49** (49) Who fear their Lord unseen,[889] while they are of the Hour apprehensive.\n\n**5** (5) But they say, \"[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams; rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign just as the previous [messengers] were sent [with miracles].\"\n\n**50** (50) And this [Qur�?n] is a blessed message which We have sent down. Then are you with it unacquainted?[890]\n\n**51** (51) And We had certainly given Abraham his sound judgement before,[891] and We were of him well-Knowing\n\n**52** (52) When he said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues to which you are devoted?\"\n\n**53** (53) They said, \"We found our fathers worshippers of them.\"\n\n**54** (54) He said, \"You were certainly, you and your fathers, in manifest error.\"\n\n**55** (55) They said, \"Have you come to us with truth, or are you of those who jest?\"\n\n**56** (56) He said, \"[No], rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth who created them, and I, to that, am of those who testify.\n\n**57** (57) And [I swear] by All?h, I will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away.\"\n\n**58** (58) So he made them into fragments, except a large one among them, that they might return to it [and question].\n\n**59** (59) They said, \"Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is of the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**6** (6) Not a [single] city which We destroyed believed before them,[872] so will they believe?\n\n**60** (60) They said, \"We heard a young man mention them who is called Abraham.\"\n\n**61** (61) They said, \"Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify.\"[892]\n\n**62** (62) They said, \"Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?\"\n\n**63** (63) He said, \"Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be able to] speak.\"\n\n**64** (64) So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said [to each other], \"Indeed, you are the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**65** (65) Then they reversed themselves,[893] [saying], \"You have already known that these do not speak!\"\n\n**66** (66) He said, \"Then do you worship instead of All?h that which does not benefit you at all or harm you?\n\n**67** (67) Uff[894] to you and to what you worship instead of All?h. Then will you not use reason?\"\n\n**68** (68) They said, \"Burn him and support your gods - if you are to act.\"\n\n**69** (69) We [i.e., All?h] said, \"O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.\"\n\n**7** (7) And We sent not before you, [O Mu?ammad], except men to whom We revealed [the message], so ask the people of the message [i.e., former scriptures] if you do not know.\n\n**70** (70) And they intended for him a plan [i.e., harm], but We made them the greatest losers.\n\n**71** (71) And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for the worlds [i.e., peoples].\n\n**72** (72) And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in addition, and all [of them] We made righteous.\n\n**73** (73) And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of zak?h; and they were worshippers of Us.\n\n**74** (74) And to Lot We gave judgement and knowledge, and We saved him from the city that was committing wicked deeds. Indeed, they were a people of evil, defiantly disobedient.\n\n**75** (75) And We admitted him into Our mercy. Indeed, he was of the righteous.\n\n**76** (76) And [mention] Noah, when he called [to All?h][895] before [that time], so We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great affliction [i.e., the flood].\n\n**77** (77) And We aided [i.e., saved] him from the people who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were a people of evil, so We drowned them, all together.\n\n**78** (78) And [mention] David and Solomon, when they judged concerning the field - when the sheep of a people overran it [at night],[896] and We were witness to their judgement.\n\n**79** (79) And We gave understanding of it [i.e., the case] to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave judgement and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains to exalt [Us], along with David and [also] the birds. And We were doing [that].[897]\n\n**8** (8) And We did not make them [i.e., the prophets] forms not eating food,[873] nor were they immortal [on earth].\n\n**80** (80) And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. So will you then be grateful?\n\n**81** (81) And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing forcefully, proceeding by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And We are ever, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**82** (82) And of the devils [i.e., jinn] were those who dived for him and did work other than that. And We were of them a guardian.[898]\n\n**83** (83) And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, \"Indeed, adversity has touched me, and You are the most merciful of the merciful.\"\n\n**84** (84) So We responded to him and removed what afflicted him of adversity. And We gave him [back] his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers [of All?h].\n\n**85** (85) And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient.\n\n**86** (86) And We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed, they were of the righteous.\n\n**87** (87) And [mention] the man of the fish [i.e., Jonah], when he went off in anger[899] and thought that We would not decree [anything] upon him.[900] And he called out within the darknesses,[901] \"There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.\"\n\n**88** (88) So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers.\n\n**89** (89) And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, \"My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while You are the best of inheritors.\"\n\n**9** (9) Then[874] We fulfilled for them the promise, and We saved them and whom We willed and destroyed the transgressors.\n\n**90** (90) So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate[902] Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.\n\n**91** (91) And [mention] the one who guarded her chastity [i.e., Mary], so We blew into her [garment] through Our angel [i.e., Gabriel], and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds.\n\n**92** (92) Indeed this, your religion, is one religion,[903] and I am your Lord, so worship Me.\n\n**93** (93) And [yet] they divided their affair [i.e., that of their religion] among themselves,[904] [but] all to Us will return.\n\n**94** (94) So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - no denial will there be for his effort,[905] and indeed We [i.e., Our angels], of it, are recorders.\n\n**95** (95) And it is prohibited to [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return[906]\n\n**96** (96) Until when [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and they, from every elevation, descend\n\n**97** (97) And [when] the true promise [i.e., the resurrection] has approached; then suddenly the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring [in horror, while they say], \"O woe to us; we had been unmindful of this; rather, we were wrongdoers.\"\n\n**98** (98) Indeed, you [disbelievers] and what you worship other than All?h are the firewood of Hell. You will be coming to [enter] it.\n\n**99** (99) Had these [false deities] been [actual] gods, they would not have come to it, but all are eternal therein."

    "content": "**1** (1) O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the [final] Hour is a terrible thing.\n\n**10** (10) \"That is for what your hands have put forth and because All?h is not ever unjust to [His] servants.\"\n\n**11** (11) And of the people is he who worships All?h on an edge.[917] If he is touched by good, he is reassured by it; but if he is struck by trial, he turns on his face [to unbelief]. He has lost [this] world and the Hereafter. That is what is the manifest loss.\n\n**12** (12) He invokes instead of All?h that which neither harms him nor benefits him. That is what is the extreme error.\n\n**13** (13) He invokes one whose harm is closer than his benefit - how wretched the protector and how wretched the associate.\n\n**14** (14) Indeed, All?h will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. Indeed, All?h does what He intends.\n\n**15** (15) Whoever should think that All?h will not support him [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] in this world and the Hereafter - let him extend a rope to the ceiling, then cut off [his breath],[918] and let him see: will his effort remove that which enrages [him]?\n\n**16** (16) And thus have We sent it [i.e., the Qur�?n] down as verses of clear evidence and because All?h guides whom He intends.\n\n**17** (17) Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associated with All?h - All?h will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed All?h is, over all things, Witness.[919]\n\n**18** (18) Do you not see [i.e., know] that to All?h prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? But upon many the punishment has been justified.[920] And he whom All?h humiliates - for him there is no bestower of honor. Indeed, All?h does what He wills.\n\n**19** (19) These[921] are two adversaries who have disputed over their Lord. But those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire. Poured upon their heads will be scalding water\n\n**2** (2) On the Day you see it every nursing mother will be distracted from that [child] she was nursing, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people [appearing] intoxicated while they are not intoxicated; but the punishment of All?h is severe.\n\n**20** (20) By which is melted that within their bellies and [their] skins.\n\n**21** (21) And for [striking] them are maces of iron.\n\n**22** (22) Every time they want to get out of it [i.e., Hellfire] from anguish, they will be returned to it, and [it will be said], \"Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire!\"\n\n**23** (23) Indeed, All?h will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and their garments therein will be silk.\n\n**24** (24) And they had been guided [in worldly life] to good speech, and they were guided to the path of the Praiseworthy.\n\n**25** (25) Indeed, those who have disbelieved and avert [people] from the way of All?h and [from] al-Masjid al-?ar?m, which We made for the people - equal are the resident therein and one from outside - and [also] whoever intends [a deed] therein[922] of deviation [in religion] by wrongdoing - We will make him taste of a painful punishment.\n\n**26** (26) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when We designated for Abraham the site of the House, [saying], \"Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform ?aw?f[923] and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate.\n\n**27** (27) And proclaim to the people the ?ajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel; they will come from every distant pass -\n\n**28** (28) That they may witness [i.e., attend] benefits for themselves and mention the name of All?h on known [i.e., specific] days over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals.[924] So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor.\n\n**29** (29) Then let them end their untidiness and fulfill their vows and perform ?aw?f around the ancient House.\"\n\n**3** (3) And of the people is he who disputes about All?h without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil.\n\n**30** (30) That [has been commanded], and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of All?h - it is best for him in the sight of his Lord. And permitted to you are the grazing livestock, except what is recited to you.[925] So avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statement,\n\n**31** (31) Inclining [only] to All?h, not associating [anything] with Him. And he who associates with All?h - it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place.\n\n**32** (32) That [is so]. And whoever honors the symbols [i.e., rites] of All?h - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts.\n\n**33** (33) For you therein [i.e., the animals marked for sacrifice] are benefits for a specified term;[926] then their place of sacrifice is at the ancient House.[927]\n\n**34** (34) And for every [religious] community We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice][928] that they may mention the name of All?h over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. For your god is one God, so to Him submit. And, [O Mu?ammad], give good tidings to the humble [before their Lord]\n\n**35** (35) Who, when All?h is mentioned, their hearts are fearful, and [to] the patient over what has afflicted them, and the establishers of prayer and those who spend from what We have provided them.\n\n**36** (36) And the camels and cattle We have appointed for you as among the symbols [i.e., rites] of All?h; for you therein is good. So mention the name of All?h upon them when lined up [for sacrifice]; and when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needy [who does not seek aid] and the beggar. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful.\n\n**37** (37) Their meat will not reach All?h, nor will their blood, but what reaches Him is piety from you. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may glorify All?h for that [to] which He has guided you; and give good tidings to the doers of good.\n\n**38** (38) Indeed, All?h defends those who have believed. Indeed, All?h does not like everyone treacherous and ungrateful.\n\n**39** (39) Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought,[929] because they were wronged. And indeed, All?h is competent to give them victory.\n\n**4** (4) It has been decreed for him [i.e., every devil] that whoever turns to him - he will misguide him and will lead him to the punishment of the Blaze.\n\n**40** (40) [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they say, \"Our Lord is All?h.\" And were it not that All?h checks the people, some by means of others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of All?h is much mentioned [i.e., praised]. And All?h will surely support those who support Him [i.e., His cause]. Indeed, All?h is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n\n**41** (41) [And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer and give zak?h and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to All?h belongs the outcome of [all] matters.\n\n**42** (42) And if they deny you, [O Mu?ammad] - so, before them, did the people of Noah and ?Aad and Tham?d deny [their prophets],\n\n**43** (43) And the people of Abraham and the people of Lot\n\n**44** (44) And the inhabitants of Madyan. And Moses was denied, so I prolonged enjoyment for the disbelievers; then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My reproach.\n\n**45** (45) And how many a city did We destroy while it was committing wrong - so it is [now] fallen into ruin[930] - and [how many] an abandoned well and [how many] a lofty palace.[931]\n\n**46** (46) So have they not traveled through the earth and have hearts by which to reason and ears by which to hear? For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts.\n\n**47** (47) And they urge you to hasten the punishment. But All?h will never fail in His promise. And indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of those which you count.\n\n**48** (48) And for how many a city did I prolong enjoyment while it was committing wrong. Then I seized it, and to Me is the [final] destination.\n\n**49** (49) Say, \"O people, I am only to you a clear warner.\"\n\n**5** (5) O people, if you should be in doubt about the Resurrection, then [consider that] indeed, We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, and then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed[915] - that We may show you.[916] And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term, then We bring you out as a child, and then [We develop you] that you may reach your [time of] maturity. And among you is he who is taken in [early] death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit [old] age so that he knows, after [once having] knowledge, nothing. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [something] of every beautiful kind.\n\n**50** (50) And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and noble provision.\n\n**51** (51) But the ones who strove against Our verses, [seeking] to cause failure[932] - those are the companions of Hellfire.\n\n**52** (52) And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], Satan threw into it [some misunderstanding]. But All?h abolishes that which Satan throws in; then All?h makes precise His verses.[933] And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**53** (53) [That is] so He may make what Satan throws in [i.e., asserts] a trial for those within whose hearts is disease[934] and those hard of heart. And indeed, the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension.\n\n**54** (54) And so those who were given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord and [therefore] believe in it, and their hearts humbly submit to it. And indeed is All?h the Guide of those who have believed to a straight path.\n\n**55** (55) But those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt of it until the Hour comes upon them unexpectedly or there comes to them the punishment of a barren Day.[935]\n\n**56** (56) [All] sovereignty that Day is for All?h;[936] He will judge between them. So they who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the Gardens of Pleasure.\n\n**57** (57) And they who disbelieved and denied Our signs - for those there will be a humiliating punishment.\n\n**58** (58) And those who emigrated for the cause of All?h and then were killed or died - All?h will surely provide for them a good provision. And indeed, it is All?h who is the best of providers.\n\n**59** (59) He will surely cause them to enter an entrance with which they will be pleased, and indeed, All?h is Knowing and Forbearing.\n\n**6** (6) That is because All?h is the True Reality and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent\n\n**60** (60) That [is so]. And whoever responds [to injustice] with the equivalent of that with which he was harmed and then is tyrannized - All?h will surely aid him. Indeed, All?h is Pardoning and Forgiving.[937]\n\n**61** (61) That[938] is because All?h causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and because All?h is Hearing and Seeing.\n\n**62** (62) That is because All?h is the True Reality, and that which they call upon other than Him is falsehood, and because All?h is the Most High, the Grand.\n\n**63** (63) Do you not see that All?h has sent down rain from the sky and the earth becomes green? Indeed, All?h is Subtle[939] and Aware.[940]\n\n**64** (64) To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. And indeed, All?h is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**65** (65) Do you not see that All?h has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His command? And He restrains the sky from falling upon the earth, unless by His permission. Indeed All?h, to the people, is Kind and Merciful.\n\n**66** (66) And He is the one who gave you life; then He causes you to die and then will [again] give you life. Indeed, mankind is ungrateful.\n\n**67** (67) For every [religious] community We have appointed rites which they perform. So, [O Mu?ammad], let them [i.e., the disbelievers] not contend with you over the matter but invite [them] to your Lord. Indeed, you are upon straight guidance.\n\n**68** (68) And if they dispute with you, then say, \"All?h is most knowing of what you do.\n\n**69** (69) All?h will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ.\"\n\n**7** (7) And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - and that All?h will resurrect those in the graves.\n\n**70** (70) Do you not know that All?h knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record.[941] Indeed that, for All?h, is easy.\n\n**71** (71) And they worship besides All?h that for which He has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge. And there will not be for the wrongdoers any helper.\n\n**72** (72) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval. They are almost on the verge of assaulting those who recite to them Our verses. Say, \"Then shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that?[942] [It is] the Fire which All?h has promised those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination.\"\n\n**73** (73) O people, an example is presented, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides All?h will never create [as much as] a fly, even if they gathered together for it [i.e., that purpose]. And if the fly should steal from them a [tiny] thing, they could not recover it from him. Weak are the pursuer and pursued.[943]\n\n**74** (74) They have not appraised All?h with true appraisal.[944] Indeed, All?h is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n\n**75** (75) All?h chooses from the angels messengers and from the people. Indeed, All?h is Hearing and Seeing.\n\n**76** (76) He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them.[945] And to All?h will be returned [all] matters.\n\n**77** (77) O you who have believed, bow and prostrate and worship your Lord and do good - that you may succeed.\n\n**78** (78) And strive for All?h with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty. [It is] the religion of your father, Abraham. He [i.e., All?h] named you \"Muslims\" before [in former scriptures] and in this [revelation] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zak?h and hold fast to All?h. He is your protector; and excellent is the protector, and excellent is the helper.\n\n**8** (8) And of the people is he who disputes about All?h without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening book [from Him],\n\n**9** (9) Twisting his neck [in arrogance] to mislead [people] from the way of All?h. For him in the world is disgrace, and We will make him taste on the Day of Resurrection the punishment of the Burning Fire [while it is said],"

It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.\n\n**101** (101) So when the Horn is blown, no relationship will there be among them that Day, nor will they ask about one another.\n\n**102** (102) And those whose scales are heavy [with good deeds] - it is they who are the successful.\n\n**103** (103) But those whose scales are light - those are the ones who have lost their souls, [being] in Hell, abiding eternally.\n\n**104** (104) The Fire will sear their faces, and they therein will have taut smiles.[968]\n\n**105** (105) [It will be said], \"Were not My verses recited to you and you used to deny them?\"\n\n**106** (106) They will say, \"Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray.\n\n**107** (107) Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would indeed be wrongdoers.\"\n\n**108** (108) He will say, \"Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me.\n\n**109** (109) Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the best of the merciful.'\n\n**11** (11) Who will inherit al-Firdaus.[948] They will abide therein eternally.\n\n**110** (110) But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.\n\n**111** (111) Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for their patient endurance - that they are the attainers [of success].\"\n\n**112** (112) [All?h] will say, \"How long did you remain on earth in number of years?\"\n\n**113** (113) They will say, \"We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate.\"\n\n**114** (114) He will say, \"You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.\n\n**115** (115) Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\"\n\n**116** (116) So exalted is All?h, the Sovereign,[969] the Truth;[970] there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne.\n\n**117** (117) And whoever invokes besides All?h another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed.\n\n**118** (118) And, [O Mu?ammad], say, \"My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful.\"\n\n**12** (12) And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay.\n\n**13** (13) Then We placed him as a sperm-drop[949] in a firm lodging [i.e., the womb].\n\n**14** (14) Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is All?h, the best of creators.[950]\n\n**15** (15) Then indeed, after that you are to die.\n\n**16** (16) Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected.\n\n**17** (17) And We have created above you seven layered heavens, and never have We been of [Our] creation unaware.\n\n**18** (18) And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away.\n\n**19** (19) And We brought forth for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines in which for you are abundant fruits and from which you eat.\n\n**2** (2) They who are during their prayer humbly intent\n\n**20** (20) And [We brought forth] a tree issuing from Mount Sinai which produces oil and food [i.e., olives] for those who eat.\n\n**21** (21) And indeed, for you in livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from that which is in their bellies, and for you in them are numerous benefits, and from them you eat.\n\n**22** (22) And upon them and on ships you are carried.\n\n**23** (23) And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, \"O my people, worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?\"\n\n**24** (24) But the eminent among those who disbelieved from his people said, \"This is not but a man like yourselves who wishes to take precedence over you; and if All?h had willed [to send a messenger], He would have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our forefathers.\n\n**25** (25) He is not but a man possessed with madness, so wait concerning him for a time.\"\n\n**26** (26) [Noah] said, \"My Lord, support me because they have denied me.\"\n\n**27** (27) So We inspired to him, \"Construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration, and when Our command comes and the oven overflows,[951] put into it [i.e., the ship] from each [creature] two mates and your family, except him for whom the decree [of destruction] has proceeded. And do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.\n\n**28** (28) And when you have boarded the ship, you and those with you, then say, 'Praise to All?h who has saved us from the wrongdoing people.'\n\n**29** (29) And say, 'My Lord, let me land at a blessed landing place, and You are the best to accommodate [us].'\"\n\n**3** (3) And they who turn away from ill speech\n\n**30** (30) Indeed in that are signs, and indeed, We are ever testing [Our servants].\n\n**31** (31) Then We produced after them a generation of others.\n\n**32** (32) And We sent among them a messenger[952] from themselves, [saying], \"Worship All?h; you have no deity other than Him; then will you not fear Him?\"\n\n**33** (33) And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter while We had given them luxury in the worldly life said, \"This is not but a man like yourselves. He eats of that from which you eat and drinks of what you drink.\n\n**34** (34) And if you should obey a man like yourselves, indeed, you would then be losers.\n\n**35** (35) Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth [once more]?\n\n**36** (36) How far, how far, is that which you are promised.[953]\n\n**37** (37) It [i.e., life] is not but our worldly life - we die and live, but we will not be resurrected.\n\n**38** (38) He is not but a man who has invented a lie about All?h, and we will not believe him.\"\n\n**39** (39) He said, \"My Lord, support me because they have denied me.\"\n\n**4** (4) And they who are observant of zak?h\n\n**40** (40) [All?h] said, \"After a little, they will surely become regretful.\"\n\n**41** (41) So the shriek[954] seized them in truth,[955] and We made them as [plant] stubble. Then away with the wrongdoing people.\n\n**42** (42) Then We produced after them other generations.\n\n**43** (43) No nation will precede its time [of termination], nor will they remain [thereafter].\n\n**44** (44) Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation its messenger, they denied him, so We made them follow one another [to destruction], and We made them narrations.[956] So away with a people who do not believe.\n\n**45** (45) Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority[957]\n\n**46** (46) To Pharaoh and his establishment, but they were arrogant and were a haughty people.\n\n**47** (47) They said, \"Should we believe two men like ourselves while their people are for us in servitude?\"\n\n**48** (48) So they denied them and were of those destroyed.\n\n**49** (49) And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture that perhaps they[958] would be guided.\n\n**5** (5) And they who guard their private parts\n\n**50** (50) And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them within a high ground having level [areas] and flowing water.\n\n**51** (51) [All?h said], \"O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Knowing.\n\n**52** (52) And indeed this, your religion, is one religion,[959] and I am your Lord, so fear Me.\"\n\n**53** (53) But they [i.e., the people] divided their religion among them into portions [i.e., sects] - each faction, in what it has,[960] rejoicing.\n\n**54** (54) So leave them in their confusion for a time.\n\n**55** (55) Do they think that what We extend to them of wealth and children\n\n**56** (56) Is [because] We hasten for them good things? Rather, they do not perceive.[961]\n\n**57** (57) Indeed, they who are apprehensive from fear of their Lord\n\n**58** (58) And they who believe in the signs of their Lord\n\n**59** (59) And they who do not associate anything with their Lord\n\n**6** (6) Except from their wives or those their right hands possess,[947] for indeed, they will not be blamed -\n\n**60** (60) And they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful[962] because they will be returning to their Lord -\n\n**61** (61) It is those who hasten to good deeds, and they outstrip [others] therein.\n\n**62** (62) And We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity, and with Us is a record which speaks with truth; and they will not be wronged.\n\n**63** (63) But their hearts are covered with confusion over this, and they have [evil] deeds besides that [i.e., disbelief] which they are doing,\n\n**64** (64) Until when We seize their affluent ones with punishment,[963] at once they are crying [to All?h] for help.\n\n**65** (65) Do not cry out today. Indeed, by Us you will not be helped.\n\n**66** (66) My verses had already been recited to you, but you were turning back on your heels\n\n**67** (67) In arrogance regarding it,[964] conversing by night, speaking evil.\n\n**68** (68) Then have they not reflected over the word [i.e., the Qur�?n], or has there come to them that which had not come to their forefathers?\n\n**69** (69) Or did they not know their Messenger, so they are toward him disacknowledging?\n\n**7** (7) But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors -\n\n**70** (70) Or do they say, \"In him is madness\"? Rather, he brought them the truth, but most of them, to the truth, are averse.\n\n**71** (71) But if the Truth [i.e., All?h] had followed their inclinations, the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. Rather, We have brought them their message,[965] but they, from their message, are turning away.\n\n**72** (72) Or do you, [O Mu?ammad], ask them for payment? But the reward of your Lord is best, and He is the best of providers.\n\n**73** (73) And indeed, you invite them to a straight path.\n\n**74** (74) But indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from the path.\n\n**75** (75) And even if We gave them mercy and removed what was upon them of affliction, they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly.\n\n**76** (76) And We had gripped them with suffering [as a warning], but they did not yield to their Lord, nor did they humbly supplicate, [and will continue thus]\n\n**77** (77) Until when We have opened before them a door of severe punishment, immediately they will be therein in despair.\n\n**78** (78) And it is He who produced for you hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful.\n\n**79** (79) And it is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.\n\n**8** (8) And they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive\n\n**80** (80) And it is He who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the night and the day. Then will you not reason?\n\n**81** (81) Rather,[966] they say like what the former peoples said.\n\n**82** (82) They said, \"When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?\n\n**83** (83) We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before; this is not but legends of the former peoples.\"\n\n**84** (84) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?\"\n\n**85** (85) They will say, \"To All?h.\" Say, \"Then will you not remember?\"\n\n**86** (86) Say, \"Who is Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Great Throne?\"\n\n**87** (87) They will say, \"[They belong] to All?h.\" Say, \"Then will you not fear Him?\"\n\n**88** (88) Say, \"In whose hand is the realm of all things - and He protects while none can protect against Him - if you should know?\"\n\n**89** (89) They will say, \"[All belongs] to All?h.\" Say, \"Then how are you deluded?\"\n\n**9** (9) And they who carefully maintain their prayers -\n\n**90** (90) Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed they are liars.\n\n**91** (91) All?h has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it created, and some of them would have [sought to] overcome others. Exalted is All?h above what they describe [concerning Him].\n\n**92** (92) [He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He above what they associate [with Him].\n\n**93** (93) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"My Lord, if You should show me that which they are promised,\n\n**94** (94) My Lord, then do not place me among the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**95** (95) And indeed, We are Able to show you what We have promised them.\n\n**96** (96) Repel, by [means of] what is best, [their] evil. We are most knowing of what they describe.\n\n**97** (97) And say, \"My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the incitements of the devils,\n\n**98** (98) And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present with me.\"\n\n**99** (99) [For such is the state of the disbelievers] until, when death comes to one of them, he says, \"My Lord, send me back"

Do not think it bad for you; rather, it is good for you. For every person among them is what [punishment] he has earned from the sin, and he who took upon himself the greater portion thereof[979] - for him is a great punishment [i.e., Hellfire].\n\n**12** (12) Why, when you heard it, did not the believing men and believing women think good of themselves [i.e., one another] and say, \"This is an obvious falsehood\"?\n\n**13** (13) Why did they [who slandered] not produce for it four witnesses? And when they do not produce the witnesses, then it is they, in the sight of All?h, who are the liars.\n\n**14** (14) And if it had not been for the favor of All?h upon you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, you would have been touched for that [lie] in which you were involved by a great punishment\n\n**15** (15) When you received it with your tongues[980] and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was, in the sight of All?h, tremendous.\n\n**16** (16) And why, when you heard it, did you not say, \"It is not for us to speak of this. Exalted are You, [O All?h]; this is a great slander\"?\n\n**17** (17) All?h warns you against returning to the likes of this [conduct], ever, if you should be believers.\n\n**18** (18) And All?h makes clear to you the verses [i.e., His rulings], and All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**19** (19) Indeed, those who like that immorality[981] should be spread [or publicized] among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And All?h knows[982] and you do not know.\n\n**2** (2) The [unmarried] woman or [unmarried] man found guilty of sexual intercourse[972] - lash each one of them with a hundred lashes,[973] and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion [i.e., law] of All?h,[974] if you should believe in All?h and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.\n\n**20** (20) And if it had not been for the favor of All?h upon you and His mercy...[983] and because All?h is Kind and Merciful.\n\n**21** (21) O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - indeed, he enjoins immorality and wrongdoing. And if not for the favor of All?h upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have been pure, ever, but All?h purifies whom He wills, and All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**22** (22) And let not those of virtue among you and wealth swear not to give [aid] to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants for the cause of All?h, and let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that All?h should forgive you? And All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**23** (23) Indeed, those who [falsely] accuse chaste, unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they will have a great punishment\n\n**24** (24) On a Day when their tongues, their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.\n\n**25** (25) That Day, All?h will pay them in full their true [i.e., deserved] recompense, and they will know that it is All?h who is the manifest Truth [i.e., perfect in justice].\n\n**26** (26) Evil words are for evil men, and evil men are [subjected] to evil words. And good words are for good men, and good men are [an object] of good words.[984] Those [good people] are declared innocent of what they [i.e., slanderers] say. For them is forgiveness and noble provision.\n\n**27** (27) O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you ascertain welcome and greet[985] their inhabitants. That is best for you; perhaps you will be reminded [i.e., advised].\n\n**28** (28) And if you do not find anyone therein, do not enter them until permission has been given you. And if it is said to you, \"Go back,\"[986] then go back; it is purer for you. And All?h is Knowing of what you do.\n\n**29** (29) There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is convenience[987] for you. And All?h knows what you reveal and what you conceal.\n\n**3** (3) The fornicator does not marry except a [female] fornicator or polytheist, and none marries her except a fornicator[975] or a polytheist, and that [i.e., marriage to such persons] has been made unlawful to the believers.\n\n**30** (30) Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision[988] and guard their private parts.[989] That is purer for them. Indeed, All?h is [fully] Aware of what they do.\n\n**31** (31) And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision[990] and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment[991] except that which [necessarily] appears thereof[992] and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment [i.e., beauty] except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess [i.e., slaves], or those male attendants having no physical desire,[993] or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to All?h in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed.\n\n**32** (32) And marry the unmarried among you and the righteous among your male slaves and female slaves. If they should be poor, All?h will enrich them from His bounty, and All?h is all-Encompassing and Knowing.\n\n**33** (33) But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until All?h enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract [for eventual emancipation] from among whom your right hands possess[994] - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of All?h which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, All?h is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**34** (34) And We have certainly sent down to you distinct verses[995] and examples from those who passed on before you and an admonition for those who fear All?h.\n\n**35** (35) All?h is the Light[996] of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light[997] is like a niche within which is a lamp;[998] the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil of] a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. All?h guides to His light whom He wills. And All?h presents examples for the people, and All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**36** (36) [Such niches are] in houses [i.e., mosques] which All?h has ordered to be raised and that His name be mentioned [i.e., praised] therein; exalting Him within them in the morning and the evenings[999]\n\n**37** (37) [Are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of All?h and performance of prayer and giving of zak?h. They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will [fearfully] turn about -\n\n**38** (38) That All?h may reward them [according to] the best of what they did and increase them from His bounty. And All?h gives provision to whom He wills without account [i.e., limit].\n\n**39** (39) But those who disbelieved - their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds All?h before him, and He will pay him in full his due; and All?h is swift in account.\n\n**4** (4) And those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after. And those are the defiantly disobedient,\n\n**40** (40) Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds - darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. And he to whom All?h has not granted light - for him there is no light.\n\n**41** (41) Do you not see that All?h is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and [by] the birds with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and exalting [Him], and All?h is Knowing of what they do.\n\n**42** (42) And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to All?h is the destination.\n\n**43** (43) Do you not see that All?h drives clouds? Then He brings them together; then He makes them into a mass, and you see the rain emerge from within it. And He sends down from the sky, mountains [of clouds] within which is hail, and He strikes with it whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of its lightning almost takes away the eyesight.\n\n**44** (44) All?h alternates the night and the day. Indeed in that is a lesson for those who have vision.\n\n**45** (45) All?h has created every [living] creature from water. And of them are those that move on their bellies, and of them are those that walk on two legs, and of them are those that walk on four. All?h creates what He wills. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**46** (46) We have certainly sent down distinct verses. And All?h guides whom He wills to a straight path.\n\n**47** (47) But they [i.e., the hypocrites] say, \"We have believed in All?h and in the Messenger, and we obey\"; then a party of them turns away after that. And those are not believers.\n\n**48** (48) And when they are called to [the words of] All?h and His Messenger to judge between them, at once a party of them turns aside [in refusal].\n\n**49** (49) But if the right is theirs, they come to him in prompt obedience.\n\n**5** (5) Except for those who repent thereafter and reform, for indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**50** (50) Is there disease in their hearts? Or have they doubted? Or do they fear that All?h will be unjust to them, or His Messenger? Rather, it is they who are the wrongdoers [i.e., the unjust].\n\n**51** (51) The only statement of the [true] believers when they are called to All?h and His Messenger to judge between them is that they say, \"We hear and we obey.\" And those are the successful.\n\n**52** (52) And whoever obeys All?h and His Messenger and fears All?h and is conscious of Him - it is those who are the attainers.\n\n**53** (53) And they swear by All?h their strongest oaths that if you ordered them, they would go forth [in All?h's cause]. Say, \"Do not swear. [Such] obedience is known.[1000] Indeed, All?h is [fully] Aware of that which you do.\"\n\n**54** (54) Say, \"Obey All?h and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away - then upon him is only that [duty] with which he has been charged, and upon you is that with which you have been charged. And if you obey him, you will be [rightly] guided. And there is not upon the Messenger except the [responsibility for] clear notification.\"\n\n**55** (55) All?h has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them and that He will surely establish for them [therein] their religion which He has preferred for them and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves[1001] after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**56** (56) And establish prayer and give zak?h and obey the Messenger - that you may receive mercy.\n\n**57** (57) Never think that the disbelievers are causing failure [to All?h] upon the earth. Their refuge will be the Fire - and how wretched the destination.\n\n**58** (58) O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and those who have not [yet] reached puberty among you ask permission of you [before entering] at three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put aside your clothing [for rest] at noon and after the night prayer. [These are] three times of privacy[1002] for you. There is no blame upon you nor upon them beyond these [periods], for they continually circulate among you - some of you, among others. Thus does All?h make clear to you the verses [i.e., His ordinances]; and All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**59** (59) And when the children among you reach puberty, let them ask permission [at all times] as those before them have done. Thus does All?h make clear to you His verses; and All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**6** (6) And those who accuse their wives [of adultery] and have no witnesses except themselves - then the witness of one of them[976] [shall be] four testimonies [swearing] by All?h that indeed, he is of the truthful.\n\n**60** (60) And women of post-menstrual age who have no desire for marriage - there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments [but] not displaying adornment. But to modestly refrain [from that] is better for them. And All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**61** (61) There is not upon the blind [any] constraint nor upon the lame constraint nor upon the ill constraint nor upon yourselves when you eat from your [own] houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your father's brothers or the houses of your father's sisters or the houses of your mother's brothers or the houses of your mother's sisters or [from houses] whose keys you possess or [from the house] of your friend. There is no blame upon you whether you eat together or separately. But when you enter houses, give greetings of peace[1003] upon each other - a greeting from All?h, blessed and good. Thus does All?h make clear to you the verses [of ordinance] that you may understand.\n\n**62** (62) The believers are only those who believe in All?h and His Messenger and, when they are [meeting] with him for a matter of common interest, do not depart until they have asked his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission, [O Mu?ammad] - those are the ones who believe in All?h and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission due to something of their affairs, then give permission to whom you will among them and ask forgiveness for them of All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**63** (63) Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already All?h knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those beware who dissent from his [i.e., the Prophet's] order,[1004] lest fitnah[1005] strike them or a painful punishment.\n\n**64** (64) Unquestionably, to All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. Already He knows that upon which you [stand][1006] and [knows] the Day[1007] when they will be returned to Him and He will inform them of what they have done. And All?h is Knowing of all things.\n\n**7** (7) And the fifth [oath will be] that the curse of All?h be upon him if he should be of the liars.\n\n**8** (8) But it will prevent punishment from her if she gives four testimonies [swearing] by All?h that indeed, he is of the liars.\n\n**9** (9) And the fifth [oath will be] that the wrath of All?h be upon her if he was of the truthful."

It will be for them a reward and destination.\n\n**16** (16) For them therein is whatever they wish, [while] abiding eternally. It is ever upon your Lord a promise [worthy to be] requested.[1010]\n\n**17** (17) And [mention] the Day He will gather them and that which they worship besides All?h and will say, \"Did you mislead these, My servants, or did they [themselves] stray from the way?\"\n\n**18** (18) They will say, \"Exalted are You! It was not for us to take besides You any allies [i.e., protectors]. But You provided comforts for them and their fathers until they forgot the message and became a people ruined.\"\n\n**19** (19) So they will deny you, [disbelievers], in what you say,[1011] and you cannot avert [punishment] or [find] help. And whoever commits injustice[1012] among you - We will make him taste a great punishment.\n\n**2** (2) He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and who has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion and has created each thing and determined it with [precise] determination.\n\n**20** (20) And We did not send before you, [O Mu?ammad], any of the messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you [people] as trial for others - will you have patience? And ever is your Lord, Seeing.\n\n**21** (21) And those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, \"Why were not angels sent down to us, or [why] do we [not] see our Lord?\" They have certainly become arrogant within themselves[1013] and [become] insolent with great insolence.\n\n**22** (22) The day they see the angels[1014] - no good tidings will there be that day for the criminals, and [the angels] will say, \"Prevented and inaccessible.\"[1015]\n\n**23** (23) And We will approach [i.e., regard][1016] what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed.\n\n**24** (24) The companions of Paradise, that Day, are [in] a better settlement and better resting place.\n\n**25** (25) And [mention] the Day when the heaven will split open with [emerging] clouds,[1017] and the angels will be sent down in successive descent.\n\n**26** (26) True sovereignty, that Day, is for the Most Merciful. And it will be upon the disbelievers a difficult Day.\n\n**27** (27) And the Day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands [in regret] he will say, \"Oh, I wish I had taken with the Messenger a way.[1018]\n\n**28** (28) Oh, woe to me! I wish I had not taken that one[1019] as a friend.\n\n**29** (29) He led me away from the remembrance[1020] after it had come to me. And ever is Satan, to man, a deserter.\"[1021]\n\n**3** (3) But they have taken besides Him gods which create nothing, while they are created, and possess not for themselves any harm or benefit and possess not [power to cause] death or life or resurrection.\n\n**30** (30) And the Messenger has said, \"O my Lord, indeed my people have taken this Qur�?n as [a thing] abandoned.\"[1022]\n\n**31** (31) And thus have We made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals. But sufficient is your Lord as a guide and a helper.\n\n**32** (32) And those who disbelieve say, \"Why was the Qur�?n not revealed to him all at once?\" Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly.[1023]\n\n**33** (33) And they do not come to you with an example [i.e., argument] except that We bring you the truth and the best explanation.\n\n**34** (34) The ones who are gathered on their faces to Hell - those are the worst in position and farthest astray in [their] way.\n\n**35** (35) And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture and appointed with him his brother Aaron as an assistant.\n\n**36** (36) And We said, \"Go both of you to the people who have denied Our signs.\" Then We destroyed them with [complete] destruction.\n\n**37** (37) And the people of Noah - when they denied the messengers,[1024] We drowned them, and We made them for mankind a sign. And We have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment.\n\n**38** (38) And [We destroyed] ?Aad and Tham?d and the companions of the well[1025] and many generations between them.\n\n**39** (39) And for each We presented examples [as warnings], and each We destroyed with [total] destruction.\n\n**4** (4) And those who disbelieve say, \"This [Qur�?n] is not except a falsehood he invented, and another people assisted him in it.\" But they have committed an injustice and a lie.\n\n**40** (40) And they have already come upon the town which was showered with a rain of evil [i.e., stones]. So have they not seen it? But they are not expecting resurrection.[1026]\n\n**41** (41) And when they see you, [O Mu?ammad], they take you not except in ridicule, [saying], \"Is this the one whom All?h has sent as a messenger?\n\n**42** (42) He almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in [worship of] them.\" But they are going to know, when they see the punishment, who is farthest astray in [his] way.\n\n**43** (43) Have you seen the one who takes as his god his own desire? Then would you be responsible for him?\n\n**44** (44) Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock.[1027] Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.\n\n**45** (45) Have you not considered your Lord - how He extends the shadow, and if He willed, He could have made it stationary? Then We made the sun for it an indication.[1028]\n\n**46** (46) Then We [retract and] hold it with Us for a brief grasp.[1029]\n\n**47** (47) And it is He who has made the night for you as clothing[1030] and sleep [a means for] rest and has made the day a resurrection.[1031]\n\n**48** (48) And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy [i.e., rainfall], and We send down from the sky pure water\n\n**49** (49) That We may bring to life thereby a dead land and give it as drink to those We created of numerous livestock and men.\n\n**5** (5) And they say, \"Legends of the former peoples which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\"\n\n**50** (50) And We have certainly distributed it among them that they might be reminded,[1032] but most of the people refuse except disbelief.\n\n**51** (51) And if We had willed, We could have sent into every city a warner.[1033]\n\n**52** (52) So do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them with it [i.e., the Qur�?n] a great striving.\n\n**53** (53) And it is He who has released [simultaneously] the two seas [i.e., bodies of water], one fresh and sweet and one salty and bitter, and He placed between them a barrier and prohibiting partition.\n\n**54** (54) And it is He who has created from water [i.e., semen] a human being and made him [a relative by] lineage and marriage. And ever is your Lord competent [concerning creation].\n\n**55** (55) But they worship rather than All?h that which does not benefit them or harm them, and the disbeliever is ever, against his Lord, an assistant [to Satan].\n\n**56** (56) And We have not sent you, [O Mu?ammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.\n\n**57** (57) Say, \"I do not ask of you for it any payment - only that whoever wills might take to his Lord a way.\"\n\n**58** (58) And rely upon the Ever-Living who does not die, and exalt [All?h] with His praise. And sufficient is He to be, with the sins of His servants, [fully] Aware -\n\n**59** (59) He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days and then established Himself above the Throne[1034] - the Most Merciful, so ask about Him one well informed [i.e., the Prophet (?)].\n\n**6** (6) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"It has been revealed by He who knows [every] secret within the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**60** (60) And when it is said to them, \"Prostrate to the Most Merciful,\" they say, \"And what is the Most Merciful? Should we prostrate to that which you order us?\" And it increases them in aversion.\n\n**61** (61) Blessed is He who has placed in the sky great stars and placed therein a [burning] lamp and luminous moon.\n\n**62** (62) And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires gratitude.\n\n**63** (63) And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily,[1035] and when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace,[1036]\n\n**64** (64) And those who spend [part of] the night to their Lord prostrating and standing [in prayer]\n\n**65** (65) And those who say, \"Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell. Indeed, its punishment is ever adhering;\n\n**66** (66) Indeed, it is evil as a settlement and residence.\"\n\n**67** (67) And [they are] those who, when they spend, do so not excessively or sparingly but are ever, between that, [justly] moderate\n\n**68** (68) And those who do not invoke[1037] with All?h another deity or kill the soul which All?h has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty.\n\n**69** (69) Multiplied for him is the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein humiliated -\n\n**7** (7) And they say, \"What is this messenger that eats food and walks in the markets? Why was there not sent down to him an angel so he would be with him a warner?\n\n**70** (70) Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them All?h will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**71** (71) And he who repents and does righteousness does indeed turn to All?h with [accepted] repentance.\n\n**72** (72) And [they are] those who do not testify to falsehood, and when they pass near ill speech, they pass by with dignity.\n\n**73** (73) And those who, when reminded of the verses of their Lord, do not fall upon them deaf and blind.\n\n**74** (74) And those who say, \"Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes[1038] and make us a leader [i.e., example] for the righteous.\"\n\n**75** (75) Those will be awarded the Chamber[1039] for what they patiently endured, and they will be received therein with greetings and [words of] peace,\n\n**76** (76) Abiding eternally therein. Good is the settlement and residence.\n\n**77** (77) Say, \"What would my Lord care for you if not for your supplication?\"[1040] For you [disbelievers] have denied, so it [i.e., your denial] is going to be adherent.[1041]\n\n**8** (8) Or [why is not] a treasure presented to him [from heaven], or does he [not] have a garden from which he eats?\" And the wrongdoers say, \"You follow not but a man affected by magic.\"\n\n**9** (9) Look how they strike for you comparisons;[1009] but they have strayed, so they cannot [find] a way."

My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**181** (181) Give full measure and do not be of those who cause loss.\n\n**182** (182) And weigh with an even [i.e., honest] balance.\n\n**183** (183) And do not deprive people of their due and do not commit abuse on earth, spreading corruption.\n\n**184** (184) And fear He who created you and the former creation.\"[1059]\n\n**185** (185) They said, \"You are only of those affected by magic.\n\n**186** (186) You are but a man like ourselves, and indeed, we think you are among the liars.\n\n**187** (187) So cause to fall upon us fragments of the sky, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**188** (188) He said, \"My Lord is most knowing of what you do.\"\n\n**189** (189) And they denied him, so the punishment of the day of the black cloud seized them. Indeed, it was the punishment of a terrible day.\n\n**19** (19) And [then] you did your deed which you did,[1046] and you were of the ungrateful.\"\n\n**190** (190) Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.\n\n**191** (191) And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.\n\n**192** (192) And indeed, it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**193** (193) The Trustworthy Spirit [i.e., Gabriel] has brought it down\n\n**194** (194) Upon your heart, [O Mu?ammad] - that you may be of the warners\n\n**195** (195) In a clear Arabic language.\n\n**196** (196) And indeed, it is [mentioned] in the scriptures of former peoples.\n\n**197** (197) And has it not been a sign to them that it is recognized by the scholars of the Children of Israel?\n\n**198** (198) And even if We had revealed it to one among the foreigners[1060]\n\n**199** (199) And he had recited it to them [perfectly],[1061] they would [still] not have been believers in it.\n\n**2** (2) These are the verses of the clear Book.\n\n**20** (20) [Moses] said, \"I did it, then, while I was of those astray [i.e., ignorant].\n\n**200** (200) Thus have We inserted it [i.e., disbelief] into the hearts of the criminals.\n\n**201** (201) They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment.\n\n**202** (202) And it will come to them suddenly while they perceive [it] not.\n\n**203** (203) And they will say, \"May we be reprieved?\"\n\n**204** (204) So for Our punishment are they impatient?\n\n**205** (205) Then have you considered if We gave them enjoyment for years\n\n**206** (206) And then there came to them that which they were promised?\n\n**207** (207) They would not be availed by the enjoyment with which they were provided.\n\n**208** (208) And We did not destroy any city except that it had warners\n\n**209** (209) As a reminder; and never have We been unjust.\n\n**21** (21) So I fled from you when I feared you. Then my Lord granted me judgement [i.e., wisdom and prophethood] and appointed me [as one] of the messengers.\n\n**210** (210) And the devils have not brought it [i.e., the revelation] down.[1062]\n\n**211** (211) It is not allowable for them, nor would they be able.\n\n**212** (212) Indeed they, from [its] hearing, are removed.[1063]\n\n**213** (213) So do not invoke[1064] with All?h another deity and [thus] be among the punished.\n\n**214** (214) And warn, [O Mu?ammad], your closest kindred.\n\n**215** (215) And lower your wing [i.e., show kindness] to those who follow you of the believers.\n\n**216** (216) And if they disobey you, then say, \"Indeed, I am disassociated from what you are doing.\"\n\n**217** (217) And rely upon the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,\n\n**218** (218) Who sees you when you arise[1065]\n\n**219** (219) And your movement among those who prostrate.[1066]\n\n**22** (22) And is this a favor of which you remind me - that you have enslaved the Children of Israel?\"\n\n**220** (220) Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**221** (221) Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?\n\n**222** (222) They descend upon every sinful liar.\n\n**223** (223) They pass on what is heard,[1067] and most of them are liars.\n\n**224** (224) And the poets - [only] the deviators follow them.\n\n**225** (225) Do you not see that in every valley they roam[1068]\n\n**226** (226) And that they say what they do not do? -\n\n**227** (227) Except those [poets] who believe and do righteous deeds and remember All?h often and defend [the Muslims][1069] after they were wronged. And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned.\n\n**23** (23) Said Pharaoh, \"And what is the Lord of the worlds?\"\n\n**24** (24) [Moses] said, \"The Lord of the heavens and earth and that between them, if you should be convinced.\"\n\n**25** (25) [Pharaoh] said to those around him, \"Do you not hear?\"\n\n**26** (26) [Moses] said, \"Your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers.\"\n\n**27** (27) [Pharaoh] said,[1047] \"Indeed, your 'messenger' who has been sent to you is mad.\"\n\n**28** (28) [Moses] said, \"Lord of the east and the west and that between them, if you were to reason.\"\n\n**29** (29) [Pharaoh] said, \"If you take a god other than me, I will surely place you among those imprisoned.\"\n\n**3** (3) Perhaps, [O Mu?ammad], you would kill yourself with grief that they will not be believers.\n\n**30** (30) [Moses] said, \"Even if I brought you something [i.e., proof] manifest?\"\n\n**31** (31) [Pharaoh] said, \"Then bring it, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**32** (32) So [Moses] threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent manifest.[1048]\n\n**33** (33) And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white for the observers.\n\n**34** (34) [Pharaoh] said to the eminent ones around him, \"Indeed, this is a learned magician.\n\n**35** (35) He wants to drive you out of your land by his magic, so what do you advise?\"\n\n**36** (36) They said, \"Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers\n\n**37** (37) Who will bring you every learned, skilled magician.\"\n\n**38** (38) So the magicians were assembled for the appointment of a well-known day.[1049]\n\n**39** (39) And it was said to the people, \"Will you congregate\n\n**4** (4) If We willed, We could send down to them from the sky a sign for which their necks would remain humbled.[1044]\n\n**40** (40) That we might follow the magicians if they are the predominant?\"\n\n**41** (41) And when the magicians arrived, they said to Pharaoh, \"Is there indeed for us a reward if we are the predominant?\"\n\n**42** (42) He said, \"Yes, and indeed, you will then be of those near [to me].\"\n\n**43** (43) Moses said to them, \"Throw whatever you will throw.\"\n\n**44** (44) So they threw their ropes and their staffs and said, \"By the might of Pharaoh, indeed it is we who are predominant.\"\n\n**45** (45) Then Moses threw his staff, and at once it devoured what they falsified.\n\n**46** (46) So the magicians fell down in prostration [to All?h].\n\n**47** (47) They said, \"We have believed in the Lord of the worlds,\n\n**48** (48) The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\"\n\n**49** (49) [Pharaoh] said, \"You believed him [i.e., Moses] before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all.\"\n\n**5** (5) And no mention [i.e., revelation] comes to them anew from the Most Merciful except that they turn away from it.\n\n**50** (50) They said, \"No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return.\n\n**51** (51) Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers.\"\n\n**52** (52) And We inspired to Moses, \"Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued.\"\n\n**53** (53) Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers[1050]\n\n**54** (54) [And said], \"Indeed, those are but a small band,\n\n**55** (55) And indeed, they are enraging us,\n\n**56** (56) And indeed, we are a cautious society...\"\n\n**57** (57) So We removed them from gardens and springs\n\n**58** (58) And treasures and honorable station[1051] -\n\n**59** (59) Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel.\n\n**6** (6) For they have already denied, but there will come to them the news of that which they used to ridicule.\n\n**60** (60) So they pursued them at sunrise.\n\n**61** (61) And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, \"Indeed, we are to be overtaken!\"\n\n**62** (62) [Moses] said, \"No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me.\"\n\n**63** (63) Then We inspired to Moses, \"Strike with your staff the sea,\" and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.\n\n**64** (64) And We advanced thereto the others [i.e., the pursuers].\n\n**65** (65) And We saved Moses and those with him, all together.\n\n**66** (66) Then We drowned the others.\n\n**67** (67) Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.\n\n**68** (68) And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.\n\n**69** (69) And recite to them the news of Abraham,\n\n**7** (7) Did they not look at the earth - how much We have produced therein from every noble kind?\n\n**70** (70) When he said to his father and his people, \"What do you worship?\"\n\n**71** (71) They said, \"We worship idols and remain to them devoted.\"\n\n**72** (72) He said, \"Do they hear you when you supplicate?\n\n**73** (73) Or do they benefit you, or do they harm?\"\n\n**74** (74) They said, \"But we found our fathers doing thus.\"\n\n**75** (75) He said, \"Then do you see what you have been worshipping,\n\n**76** (76) You and your ancient forefathers?\n\n**77** (77) Indeed, they are enemies to me, except the Lord of the worlds,[1052]\n\n**78** (78) Who created me, and He [it is who] guides me.\n\n**79** (79) And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink.\n\n**8** (8) Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers.\n\n**80** (80) And when I am ill, it is He who cures me\n\n**81** (81) And who will cause me to die and then bring me to life\n\n**82** (82) And who I aspire that He will forgive me my sin on the Day of Recompense.\"\n\n**83** (83) [And he said], \"My Lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.\n\n**84** (84) And grant me a mention [i.e., reputation] of honor among later generations.\n\n**85** (85) And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure.\n\n**86** (86) And forgive my father. Indeed, he has been of those astray.\n\n**87** (87) And do not disgrace me on the Day they are [all] resurrected -\n\n**88** (88) The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children\n\n**89** (89) But only one who comes to All?h with a sound heart.\"\n\n**9** (9) And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.\n\n**90** (90) And Paradise will be brought near [that Day] to the righteous.\n\n**91** (91) And Hellfire will be brought forth for the deviators,\n\n**92** (92) And it will be said to them, \"Where are those you used to worship\n\n**93** (93) Other than All?h? Can they help you or help themselves?\"\n\n**94** (94) So they will be overturned into it [i.e., Hellfire], they and the deviators\n\n**95** (95) And the soldiers of Iblees, all together.\n\n**96** (96) They will say while they dispute therein,\n\n**97** (97) \"By All?h, we were indeed in manifest error\n\n**98** (98) When we equated you with the Lord of the worlds.\n\n**99** (99) And no one misguided us except the criminals."

    "content": "**1** (1) ??, Seen.[1071] These are the verses of the Qur�?n [i.e., recitation] and a clear Book\n\n**10** (10) And [he was told], \"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake, he turned in flight and did not return.[1072] [All?h said], \"O Moses, fear not. Indeed, in My presence the messengers do not fear.\n\n**11** (11) Otherwise, he who wrongs, then substitutes good after evil - indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**12** (12) And put your hand into the opening of your garment [at the breast]; it will come out white without disease. [These are] among the nine signs [you will take] to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient.\"\n\n**13** (13) But when there came to them Our visible signs, they said, \"This is obvious magic.\"\n\n**14** (14) And they rejected them, while their [inner] selves were convinced thereof, out of injustice and haughtiness. So see how was the end of the corrupters.\n\n**15** (15) And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, \"Praise [is due] to All?h, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.\"\n\n**16** (16) And Solomon inherited David. He said, \"O people, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given from all things. Indeed, this is evident bounty.\"\n\n**17** (17) And gathered for Solomon were his soldiers of the jinn and men and birds, and they were [marching] in rows\n\n**18** (18) Until, when they came upon the valley of the ants, an ant said, \"O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by Solomon and his soldiers while they perceive not.\"\n\n**19** (19) So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, \"My Lord, enable me[1073] to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants.\"[1074]\n\n**2** (2) As guidance and good tidings for the believers\n\n**20** (20) And he took attendance of the birds and said, \"Why do I not see the hoopoe - or is he among the absent?\n\n**21** (21) I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him unless he brings me clear authorization.\"[1075]\n\n**22** (22) But he [i.e., the hoopoe] stayed not long and said, \"I have encompassed [in knowledge] that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with certain news.\n\n**23** (23) Indeed, I found [there] a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a great throne.\n\n**24** (24) I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of All?h, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from [His] way, so they are not guided,\n\n**25** (25) [And] so they do not prostrate to All?h, who brings forth what is hidden within the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare -\n\n**26** (26) All?h - there is no deity except Him, Lord of the Great Throne.\"\n\n**27** (27) [Solomon] said, \"We will see whether you were truthful or were of the liars.\n\n**28** (28) Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then leave them and see what [answer] they will return.\"\n\n**29** (29) She said, \"O eminent ones, indeed, to me has been delivered a noble letter.\n\n**3** (3) Who establish prayer and give zak?h, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith].\n\n**30** (30) Indeed, it is from Solomon, and indeed, it is [i.e., reads]: 'In the name of All?h, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,\n\n**31** (31) Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission [as Muslims].'\"\n\n**32** (32) She said, \"O eminent ones, advise me in my affair. I would not decide a matter until you witness [for] me.\"[1076]\n\n**33** (33) They said, \"We are men of strength and of great military might, but the command is yours, so see what you will command.\"\n\n**34** (34) She said, \"Indeed kings - when they enter a city, they ruin it and render the honored of its people humbled. And thus do they do.\n\n**35** (35) But indeed, I will send to them a gift and see with what [reply] the messengers will return.\"\n\n**36** (36) So when they came to Solomon, he said, \"Do you provide me with wealth? But what All?h has given me is better than what He has given you. Rather, it is you who rejoice in your gift.\n\n**37** (37) Return to them, for we will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter, and we will surely expel them therefrom in humiliation, and they will be debased.\"\n\n**38** (38) [Solomon] said, \"O assembly [of jinn], which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?\"\n\n**39** (39) A powerful one from among the jinn said, \"I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [task] strong and trustworthy.\"\n\n**4** (4) Indeed, for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have made pleasing to them their deeds, so they wander blindly.\n\n**40** (40) Said one who had knowledge from the Scripture, \"I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.\" And when [Solomon] saw it placed before him, he said, \"This is from the favor of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful - his gratitude is only for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever is ungrateful - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous.\"\n\n**41** (41) He said, \"Disguise for her her throne; we will see whether she will be guided [to truth] or will be of those who is not guided.\"\n\n**42** (42) So when she arrived, it was said [to her], \"Is your throne like this?\" She said, \"[It is] as though it was it.\" [Solomon said], \"And we were given knowledge before her, and we have been Muslims [in submission to All?h].\n\n**43** (43) And that which she was worshipping other than All?h had averted her [from submission to Him]. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people.\"\n\n**44** (44) She was told, \"Enter the palace.\" But when she saw it, she thought it was a body of water[1077] and uncovered her shins [to wade through]. He said, \"Indeed, it is a palace [whose floor is] made smooth with glass.\" She said, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to All?h, Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**45** (45) And We had certainly sent to Tham?d their brother ??li?, [saying], \"Worship All?h,\" and at once they were two parties conflicting.\n\n**46** (46) He said, \"O my people, why are you impatient for evil before [i.e., instead of] good?[1078] Why do you not seek forgiveness of All?h that you may receive mercy?\"\n\n**47** (47) They said, \"We consider you a bad omen, you and those with you.\" He said, \"Your omen [i.e., fate] is with All?h. Rather, you are a people being tested.\"[1079]\n\n**48** (48) And there were in the city nine family heads causing corruption in the land and not amending [its affairs].\n\n**49** (49) They said, \"Take a mutual oath by All?h that we will kill him by night, he and his family. Then we will say to his executor,[1080] 'We did not witness the destruction of his family, and indeed, we are truthful.'\"\n\n**5** (5) Those are the ones for whom there will be the worst of punishment, and in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers.\n\n**50** (50) And they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.\n\n**51** (51) Then look how was the outcome of their plan - that We destroyed them and their people, all.\n\n**52** (52) So those are their houses, desolate because of the wrong they had done. Indeed in that is a sign for people who know.\n\n**53** (53) And We saved those who believed and used to fear All?h.\n\n**54** (54) And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, \"Do you commit immorality[1081] while you are seeing?[1082]\n\n**55** (55) Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly.\"\n\n**56** (56) But the answer of his people was not except that they said, \"Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure.\"\n\n**57** (57) So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be of those who remained behind.\n\n**58** (58) And We rained upon them a rain [of stones], and evil was the rain of those who were warned.\n\n**59** (59) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Praise be to All?h, and peace upon His servants whom He has chosen. Is All?h better or what they associate with Him?\"\n\n**6** (6) And indeed, [O Mu?ammad], you receive the Qur�?n from one Wise and Knowing.\n\n**60** (60) [More precisely], is He [not best] who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you rain from the sky, causing to grow thereby gardens of joyful beauty which you could not [otherwise] have grown the trees thereof? Is there a deity with All?h?[1083] [No], but they are a people who ascribe equals [to Him].\n\n**61** (61) Is He [not best] who made the earth a stable ground and placed within it rivers and made for it firmly set mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier? Is there a deity with All?h? [No], but most of them do not know.\n\n**62** (62) Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth?[1084] Is there a deity with All?h? Little do you remember.\n\n**63** (63) Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy? Is there a deity with All?h? High is All?h above whatever they associate with Him.\n\n**64** (64) Is He [not best] who begins creation and then repeats it and who provides for you from the heaven and earth? Is there a deity with All?h? Say, \"Produce your proof, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**65** (65) Say, \"None in the heavens and earth knows the unseen except All?h, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected.\"\n\n**66** (66) Rather, their knowledge is arrested concerning the Hereafter. Rather, they are in doubt about it. Rather, they are, concerning it, blind.\n\n**67** (67) And those who disbelieve say, \"When we have become dust as well as our forefathers, will we indeed be brought out [of the graves]?\n\n**68** (68) We have been promised this, we and our forefathers, before. This is not but legends of the former peoples.\"\n\n**69** (69) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Proceed [i.e., travel] through the land and observe how was the end of the criminals.\"\n\n**7** (7) [Mention] when Moses said to his family, \"Indeed, I have perceived a fire. I will bring you from there information or will bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves.\"\n\n**70** (70) And grieve not over them or be in distress from what they conspire.\n\n**71** (71) And they say, \"When is [the fulfillment of] this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**72** (72) Say, \"Perhaps it is close behind you [i.e., very near] - some of that for which you are impatient.\n\n**73** (73) And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of bounty for the people, but most of them are not grateful.\"\n\n**74** (74) And indeed, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare.\n\n**75** (75) And there is nothing concealed[1085] within the heaven and the earth except that it is in a clear Register.[1086]\n\n**76** (76) Indeed, this Qur�?n relates to the Children of Israel most of that over which they disagree.\n\n**77** (77) And indeed, it is guidance and mercy for the believers.\n\n**78** (78) Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His [wise] judgement. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\n\n**79** (79) So rely upon All?h; indeed, you are upon the clear truth.\n\n**8** (8) But when he came to it, he was called, \"Blessed is whoever is at the fire and whoever is around it. And exalted is All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**80** (80) Indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they have turned their backs retreating.\n\n**81** (81) And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [i.e., submitting to All?h].\n\n**82** (82) And when the word [i.e., decree] befalls them,[1087] We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth speaking to them, [saying] that the people were, of Our verses, not certain [in faith].\n\n**83** (83) And [warn of] the Day when We will gather from every nation a company of those who deny Our signs, and they will be [driven] in rows\n\n**84** (84) Until, when they arrive [at the place of Judgement], He will say, \"Did you deny My signs while you encompassed them not in knowledge, or what [was it that] you were doing?\"\n\n**85** (85) And the decree will befall them[1088] for the wrong they did, and they will not [be able to] speak.\n\n**86** (86) Do they not see that We made the night that they may rest therein and the day giving sight? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.\n\n**87** (87) And [warn of] the Day the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified except whom All?h wills. And all will come to Him humbled.\n\n**88** (88) And you see the mountains, thinking them motionless,[1089] while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of All?h, who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Aware of that which you do.\n\n**89** (89) Whoever comes [at Judgement] with a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be safe.\n\n**9** (9) O Moses, indeed it is I - All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\n**90** (90) And whoever comes with an evil deed[1090] - their faces will be overturned into the Fire, [and it will be said], \"Are you recompensed except for what you used to do?\"\n\n**91** (91) [Say, O Mu?ammad], \"I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city,[1091] who made it sacred and to whom [belongs] all things. And I am commanded to be of the Muslims [i.e., those who submit to All?h]\n\n**92** (92) And to recite the Qur�?n.\" And whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] himself; and whoever strays - say, \"I am only [one] of the warners.\"\n\n**93** (93) And say, \"[All] praise is [due] to All?h. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do.\""

    "content": "**1** (1) ??, Seen, Meem.[1093]\n\n**10** (10) And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers.\n\n**11** (11) And she said to his sister, \"Follow him\"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not.\n\n**12** (12) And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before,[1096] so she said, \"Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?\"\n\n**13** (13) So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of All?h is true. But most of them [i.e., the people] do not know.\n\n**14** (14) And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good.\n\n**15** (15) And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people[1097] and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy. And the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, \"This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy.\"\n\n**16** (16) He said, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me,\" and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\n**17** (17) He said, \"My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals.\"\n\n**18** (18) And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure], when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him [once again]. Moses said to him, \"Indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator.\"\n\n**19** (19) And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he[1098] said, \"O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders.\"\n\n**2** (2) These are verses of the clear Book.\n\n**20** (20) And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, \"O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors.\"\n\n**21** (21) So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, \"My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**22** (22) And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way.\"\n\n**23** (23) And when he came to the water [i.e., well] of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women holding back [their flocks]. He said, \"What is your circumstance?\" They said, \"We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.\"\n\n**24** (24) So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, \"My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.\"\n\n**25** (25) Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, \"Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.\" So when he came to him[1099] and related to him the story, he said, \"Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.\"\n\n**26** (26) One of the women said, \"O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.\"\n\n**27** (27) He said, \"Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if All?h wills, from among the righteous.\"\n\n**28** (28) [Moses] said, \"That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and All?h, over what we say, is Witness.\"\n\n**29** (29) And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, \"Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.\"\n\n**3** (3) We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for a people who believe.\n\n**30** (30) But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree,[1100] \"O Moses, indeed I am All?h, Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**31** (31) And [he was told], \"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return.[1101] [All?h said], \"O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure.\n\n**32** (32) Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient.\"\n\n**33** (33) He said, \"My Lord, indeed I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me.\n\n**34** (34) And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.\"\n\n**35** (35) [All?h] said, \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant.\"\n\n**36** (36) But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, \"This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers.\"\n\n**37** (37) And Moses said, \"My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home.[1102] Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed.\"\n\n**38** (38) And Pharaoh said, \"O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O H?m?n, [a fire] upon the clay[1103] and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars.\"\n\n**39** (39) And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.\n\n**4** (4) Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters.\n\n**40** (40) So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea.[1104] So see how was the end of the wrongdoers.\n\n**41** (41) And We made them leaders[1105] inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped.\n\n**42** (42) And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised.[1106]\n\n**43** (43) And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded.\n\n**44** (44) And you, [O Mu?ammad], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We revealed to Moses the command, and you were not among the witnesses [to that].\n\n**45** (45) But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and prolonged was their duration.[1107] And you were not a resident among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were senders [of this message].[1108]\n\n**46** (46) And you were not at the side of the mount when We called [Moses] but [were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no warner had come before you that they might be reminded.\n\n**47** (47) And if not that a disaster should strike them for what their hands put forth [of sins] and they would say, \"Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses and been among the believers?\"...[1109]\n\n**48** (48) But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why was he not given like that which was given to Moses?\" Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses before? They said, \"[They are but] two works of magic supporting each other,[1110] and indeed we are, in both, disbelievers.\"\n\n**49** (49) Say, \"Then bring a scripture from All?h which is more guiding than either of them that I may follow it, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**5** (5) And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors\n\n**50** (50) But if they do not respond to you - then know that they only follow their [own] desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from All?h? Indeed, All?h does not guide the wrongdoing people.\n\n**51** (51) And We have [repeatedly] conveyed to them the word [i.e., the Qur�?n] that they might be reminded.\n\n**52** (52) Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they[1111] are believers in it.\n\n**53** (53) And when it is recited to them, they say, \"We have believed in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were, [even] before it, Muslims [i.e., submitting to All?h].\"\n\n**54** (54) Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and [because] they avert evil through good, and from what We have provided them they spend.\n\n**55** (55) And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, \"For us are our deeds, and for you are your deeds. Peace will be upon you;[1112] we seek not the ignorant.\"\n\n**56** (56) Indeed, [O Mu?ammad], you do not guide whom you like, but All?h guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided.\n\n**57** (57) And they [i.e., the Quraysh] say, \"If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be swept[1113] from our land.\" Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of them do not know.\n\n**58** (58) And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its [way of] living, and those are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them except briefly.[1114] And it is We who were the inheritors.\n\n**59** (59) And never would your Lord have destroyed the cities until He had sent to their mother [i.e., principal city] a messenger reciting to them Our verses. And We would not destroy the cities except while their people were wrongdoers.\n\n**6** (6) And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] H?m?n and their soldiers through them[1094] that which they had feared.\n\n**60** (60) And whatever thing you [people] have been given - it is [only for] the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment. And what is with All?h is better and more lasting; so will you not use reason?\n\n**61** (61) Then is he whom We have promised a good promise which he will meet [i.e., obtain] like he for whom We provided enjoyment of worldly life [but] then he is, on the Day of Resurrection, among those presented [for punishment in Hell]?\n\n**62** (62) And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' which you used to claim?\"\n\n**63** (63) Those upon whom the word[1115] will have come into effect will say, \"Our Lord, these are the ones we led to error. We led them to error just as we were in error. We declare our disassociation [from them] to You. They did not used to worship [i.e., obey] us.\"[1116]\n\n**64** (64) And it will be said, \"Invoke your 'partners,'\" and they will invoke them; but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. If only they had followed guidance!\n\n**65** (65) And [mention] the Day He will call them and say, \"What did you answer the messengers?\"\n\n**66** (66) But the information[1117] will be unapparent to them that Day, so they will not [be able to] ask one another.\n\n**67** (67) But as for one who had repented, believed, and done righteousness, it is expected [i.e., promised by All?h] that he will be among the successful.\n\n**68** (68) And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses; not for them was the choice. Exalted is All?h and high above what they associate with Him.\n\n**69** (69) And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare.\n\n**7** (7) And We inspired to the mother of Moses, \"Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers.\"\n\n**70** (70) And He is All?h; there is no deity except Him. To Him is [due all] praise in the first [life] and the Hereafter. And His is the [final] decision, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**71** (71) Say, \"Have you considered:[1118] if All?h should make for you the night continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity other than All?h could bring you light? Then will you not hear?\"\n\n**72** (72) Say, \"Have you considered: if All?h should make for you the day continuous until the Day of Resurrection, what deity other than All?h could bring you a night in which you may rest? Then will you not see?\"\n\n**73** (73) And out of His mercy He made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and [by day] seek from His bounty and [that] perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**74** (74) And [warn of] the Day He will call them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' which you used to claim?\"\n\n**75** (75) And We will extract from every nation a witness and say, \"Produce your proof,\" and they will know that the truth belongs to All?h, and lost from them is that which they used to invent.\n\n**76** (76) Indeed, Q?r?n was from the people of Moses, but he tyrannized them. And We gave him of treasures whose keys would burden a band of strong men; thereupon his people said to him, \"Do not exult. Indeed, All?h does not like the exultant.\n\n**77** (77) But seek, through that which All?h has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and [yet], do not forget your share of the world. And do good as All?h has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, All?h does not like corrupters.\"\n\n**78** (78) He said, \"I was only given it because of knowledge I have.\" Did he not know that All?h had destroyed before him of generations those who were greater than him in power and greater in accumulation [of wealth]? But the criminals, about their sins, will not be asked.[1119]\n\n**79** (79) So he came out before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the worldly life said, \"Oh, would that we had like what was given to Q?r?n. Indeed, he is one of great fortune.\"\n\n**8** (8) And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and H?m?n and their soldiers were deliberate sinners.\n\n**80** (80) But those who had been given knowledge said, \"Woe to you! The reward of All?h is better for he who believes and does righteousness. And none are granted it except the patient.\"\n\n**81** (81) And We caused the earth to swallow him and his home. And there was for him no company to aid him other than All?h, nor was he of those who [could] defend themselves.\n\n**82** (82) And those who had wished for his position the previous day began to say, \"Oh, how All?h extends provision to whom He wills of His servants and restricts it! If not that All?h had conferred favor on us, He would have caused it to swallow us. Oh, how the disbelievers do not succeed!\"\n\n**83** (83) That home of the Hereafter We assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous.\n\n**84** (84) Whoever comes [on the Day of Judgement] with a good deed will have better than it; and whoever comes with an evil deed - then those who did evil deeds will not be recompensed except [as much as] what they used to do.\n\n**85** (85) Indeed, [O Mu?ammad], He who imposed upon you the Qur�?n will take you back to a place of return.[1120] Say, \"My Lord is most knowing of who brings guidance and who is in clear error.\"\n\n**86** (86) And you were not expecting that the Book would be conveyed to you, but [it is] a mercy from your Lord. So do not be an assistant to the disbelievers.[1121]\n\n**87** (87) And never let them avert you from the verses of All?h after they have been revealed to you. And invite [people] to your Lord. And never be of those who associate others with All?h.\n\n**88** (88) And do not invoke with All?h another deity. There is no deity except Him. Everything will be destroyed except His Face.[1122] His is the judgement, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**9** (9) And the wife of Pharaoh said, \"[He will be] a comfort of the eye [i.e., pleasure] for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they perceived not.[1095]"

    "content": "**1** (1) Alif, L?m, Meem.[1124]\n\n**10** (10) And of the people are some who say, \"We believe in All?h,\" but when one [of them] is harmed for [the cause of] All?h, he considers the trial [i.e., harm] of the people as [if it were] the punishment of All?h. But if victory comes from your Lord, they say, \"Indeed, We were with you.\" Is not All?h most knowing of what is within the breasts of the worlds [i.e., all creatures]?\n\n**11** (11) And All?h will surely make evident those who believe, and He will surely make evident the hypocrites.\n\n**12** (12) And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Follow our way, and we will carry your sins.\"[1126] But they will not carry anything of their sins. Indeed, they are liars.\n\n**13** (13) But they will surely carry their [own] burdens and [other] burdens along with their burdens,[1127] and they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to invent.\n\n**14** (14) And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.\n\n**15** (15) But We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We made it[1128] a sign for the worlds.\n\n**16** (16) And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, \"Worship All?h and fear Him. That is best for you, if you should know.\n\n**17** (17) You only worship, besides All?h, idols, and you produce a falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides All?h do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from All?h provision and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned.\"\n\n**18** (18) And if you [people] deny [the message] - already nations before you have denied. And there is not upon the Messenger except [the duty of] clear notification.[1129]\n\n**19** (19) Have they not considered how All?h begins creation and then repeats it? Indeed that, for All?h, is easy.\n\n**2** (2) Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried?\n\n**20** (20) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Travel through the land and observe how He began creation. Then All?h will produce the final creation [i.e., development]. Indeed All?h, over all things, is competent.\"\n\n**21** (21) He punishes whom He wills and has mercy upon whom He wills, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**22** (22) And you will not cause failure [to All?h] upon the earth or in the heaven. And you have not other than All?h any protector or any helper.\n\n**23** (23) And the ones who disbelieve in the signs of All?h and the meeting with Him - those have despaired of My mercy, and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**24** (24) And the answer of his [i.e., Abraham's] people was not but that they said, \"Kill him or burn him,\" but All?h saved him from the fire. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.\n\n**25** (25) And [Abraham] said, \"You have only taken, other than All?h, idols as [a bond of] affection among you in worldly life. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will deny one another and curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you will not have any helpers.\"\n\n**26** (26) And Lot believed him. [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, I will emigrate to [the service of] my Lord. Indeed, He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\n**27** (27) And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob and placed in his descendants prophethood and scripture. And We gave him his reward in this world, and indeed, he is in the Hereafter among the righteous.\n\n**28** (28) And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, \"Indeed, you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds.\n\n**29** (29) Indeed, you approach men and obstruct the road[1130] and commit in your meetings [every] evil.\" And the answer of his people was not but that they said, \"Bring us the punishment of All?h, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**3** (3) But We have certainly tried those before them, and All?h will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars.\n\n**30** (30) He said, \"My Lord, support me against the corrupting people.\"\n\n**31** (31) And when Our messengers [i.e., angels] came to Abraham with the good tidings,[1131] they said, \"Indeed, we will destroy the people of that [i.e., Lot's] city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers.\"\n\n**32** (32) [Abraham] said, \"Indeed, within it is Lot.\" They said, \"We are more knowing of who is within it. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife. She is to be of those who remain behind.\"\n\n**33** (33) And when Our messengers [i.e., angels] came to Lot, he was distressed for them and felt for them great discomfort.[1132] They said, \"Fear not, nor grieve. Indeed, we will save you and your family, except your wife; she is to be of those who remain behind.\n\n**34** (34) Indeed, we will bring down on the people of this city punishment from the sky because they have been defiantly disobedient.\"\n\n**35** (35) And We have certainly left of it a sign as clear evidence for a people who use reason.\n\n**36** (36) And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu?ayb, and he said, \"O my people, worship All?h and expect the Last Day and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\"\n\n**37** (37) But they denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home [corpses] fallen prone.\n\n**38** (38) And [We destroyed] ?Aad and Tham?d, and it has become clear to you from their [ruined] dwellings. And Satan had made pleasing to them their deeds and averted them from the path, and they were endowed with perception.\n\n**39** (39) And [We destroyed] Q?r?n and Pharaoh and H?m?n. And Moses had already come to them with clear evidences, and they were arrogant in the land, but they were not outrunners [of Our punishment].\n\n**4** (4) Or do those who do evil deeds think they can outrun [i.e., escape] Us? Evil is what they judge.\n\n**40** (40) So each We seized for his sin; and among them were those upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the blast [from the sky], and among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. And All?h would not have wronged them, but it was they who were wronging themselves.\n\n**41** (41) The example of those who take allies other than All?h is like that of the spider who takes [i.e., constructs] a home. And indeed, the weakest of homes is the home of the spider, if they only knew.\n\n**42** (42) Indeed, All?h knows whatever thing they call upon[1133] other than Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**43** (43) And these examples We present to the people, but none will understand them except those of knowledge.\n\n**44** (44) All?h created the heavens and the earth in truth. Indeed in that is a sign for the believers.\n\n**45** (45) Recite, [O Mu?ammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of All?h is greater. And All?h knows that which you do.\n\n**46** (46) And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him.\"\n\n**47** (47) And thus We have sent down to you the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n]. And those to whom We [previously] gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these [people of Makkah] are those who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers.\n\n**48** (48) And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand. Then [i.e., otherwise] the falsifiers would have had [cause for] doubt.\n\n**49** (49) Rather, it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is distinct verses [preserved] within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers.\n\n**5** (5) Whoever should hope for the meeting with All?h - indeed, the term [decreed by] All?h is coming. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**50** (50) But they say, \"Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"The signs are only with All?h, and I am only a clear warner.\"\n\n**51** (51) And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.\n\n**52** (52) Say, \"Sufficient is All?h between me and you as Witness. He knows what is in the heavens and earth. And they who have believed in falsehood and disbelieved in All?h - it is those who are the losers.\"\n\n**53** (53) And they urge you to hasten the punishment. And if not for [the decree of] a specified term, punishment would have reached them. But it will surely come to them suddenly while they perceive not.\n\n**54** (54) They urge you to hasten the punishment. And indeed, Hell will be encompassing of the disbelievers\n\n**55** (55) On the Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from below their feet and it is said, \"Taste [the result of] what you used to do.\"\n\n**56** (56) O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious, so worship only Me.\n\n**57** (57) Every soul will taste death. Then to Us will you be returned.\n\n**58** (58) And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We will surely assign to them of Paradise [elevated] chambers beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Excellent is the reward of the [righteous] workers\n\n**59** (59) Who have been patient and upon their Lord rely.\n\n**6** (6) And whoever strives only strives for [the benefit of] himself. Indeed, All?h is Free from need of the worlds.\n\n**60** (60) And how many a creature carries not its [own] provision. All?h provides for it and for you. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**61** (61) If you asked them, \"Who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon?\" they would surely say, \"All?h.\" Then how are they deluded?\n\n**62** (62) All?h extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts for him. Indeed All?h is, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**63** (63) And if you asked them, \"Who sends down rain from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness?\" they would surely say, \"All?h.\" Say, \"Praise to All?h\"; but most of them do not reason.\n\n**64** (64) And this worldly life is not but diversion and amusement. And indeed, the home of the Hereafter - that is the [eternal] life, if only they knew.\n\n**65** (65) And when they board a ship, they supplicate All?h, sincere to Him in religion [i.e., faith and hope]. But when He delivers them to the land, at once they associate others with Him\n\n**66** (66) So that they will deny what We have granted them, and they will enjoy themselves. But they are going to know.[1134]\n\n**67** (67) Have they not seen that We made [Makkah] a safe sanctuary, while people are being taken away[1135] all around them? Then in falsehood do they believe, and in the favor of All?h they disbelieve?\n\n**68** (68) And who is more unjust than one who invents a lie about All?h or denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a [sufficient] residence for the disbelievers?\n\n**69** (69) And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways.[1136] And indeed, All?h is with the doers of good.\n\n**7** (7) And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do.\n\n**8** (8) And We have enjoined upon man goodness to parents. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge,[1125] do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.\n\n**9** (9) And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely admit them among the righteous [into Paradise]."

And [exalted is He] at night and when you are at noon.\n\n**19** (19) He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and brings to life the earth after its lifelessness. And thus will you be brought out.[1143]\n\n**2** (2) The Byzantines have been defeated[1139]\n\n**20** (20) And of His signs is that He created you from dust; then, suddenly you were human beings dispersing [throughout the earth].\n\n**21** (21) And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.\n\n**22** (22) And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and your colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge.\n\n**23** (23) And of His signs is your sleep by night and day and your seeking of His bounty. Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen.\n\n**24** (24) And of His signs is [that] He shows you the lightning [causing] fear and aspiration, and He sends down rain from the sky by which He brings to life the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that are signs for a people who use reason.\n\n**25** (25) And of His signs is that the heaven and earth stand [i.e., remain] by His command. Then when He calls you with a [single] call from the earth, immediately you will come forth.\n\n**26** (26) And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and earth. All are to Him devoutly obedient.\n\n**27** (27) And it is He who begins creation; then He repeats it, and that is [even] easier for Him. To Him belongs the highest description [i.e., attribute] in the heavens and earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**28** (28) He presents to you an example from yourselves. Do you have among those whom your right hands possess [i.e., slaves] any partners in what We have provided for you so that you are equal therein [and] would fear them as your fear of one another [within a partnership]?[1144] Thus do We detail the verses for a people who use reason.\n\n**29** (29) But those who wrong follow their [own] desires without knowledge. Then who can guide one whom All?h has sent astray? And for them there are no helpers.\n\n**3** (3) In the nearest land.[1140] But they, after their defeat, will overcome\n\n**30** (30) So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fi?rah[1145] of All?h upon which He has created [all] people. No change should there be in the creation of All?h.[1146] That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**31** (31) [Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with All?h\n\n**32** (32) [Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has.[1147]\n\n**33** (33) And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord,\n\n**34** (34) So that they will deny what We have granted them.[1148] Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.\n\n**35** (35) Or have We sent down to them an authority [i.e., a proof or scripture], and it speaks of what they have been associating with Him?\n\n**36** (36) And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth, immediately they despair.\n\n**37** (37) Do they not see that All?h extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.\n\n**38** (38) So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the face [i.e., approval] of All?h, and it is they who will be the successful.\n\n**39** (39) And whatever you give for interest [i.e., advantage] to increase within the wealth of people[1149] will not increase with All?h. But what you give in zak?h,[1150] desiring the face [i.e., approval] of All?h - those are the multipliers.[1151]\n\n**4** (4) Within three to nine years. To All?h belongs the command [i.e., decree] before and after. And that day the believers will rejoice\n\n**40** (40) All?h is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your \"partners\" who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\n\n**41** (41) Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He [i.e., All?h] may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].\n\n**42** (42) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before. Most of them were associators [of others with All?h].\n\n**43** (43) So direct your face [i.e., self] toward the correct religion before a Day comes from All?h of which there is no repelling. That Day, they will be divided.[1152]\n\n**44** (44) Whoever disbelieves - upon him is [the consequence of] his disbelief. And whoever does righteousness - they are for themselves preparing,\n\n**45** (45) That He may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not like the disbelievers.\n\n**46** (46) And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste His mercy [i.e., rain] and so the ships may sail at His command and so you may seek of His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**47** (47) And We have already sent messengers before you to their peoples, and they came to them with clear evidences; then We took retribution from those who committed crimes, and incumbent upon Us was support[1153] of the believers.\n\n**48** (48) It is All?h who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice\n\n**49** (49) Although they were, before it was sent down upon them - before that, in despair.\n\n**5** (5) In the victory of All?h.[1141] He gives victory to whom He wills, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.\n\n**50** (50) So observe the effects of the mercy of All?h - how He gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed, that [same one] will give life to the dead, and He is over all things competent.\n\n**51** (51) But if We should send a [bad] wind and they saw [their crops] turned yellow, they would remain thereafter disbelievers.[1154]\n\n**52** (52) So indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs, retreating.\n\n**53** (53) And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [in submission to All?h].\n\n**54** (54) All?h is the one who created you from weakness, then made after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness and white hair. He creates what He wills, and He is the Knowing, the Competent.\n\n**55** (55) And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour. Thus they were deluded.\n\n**56** (56) But those who were given knowledge and faith will say, \"You remained the extent of All?h's decree until the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not used to know.\"[1155]\n\n**57** (57) So that Day, their excuse will not benefit those who wronged, nor will they be asked to appease [All?h].\n\n**58** (58) And We have certainly presented to the people in this Qur�?n from every [kind of] example. But, [O Mu?ammad], if you should bring them a sign, the disbelievers will surely say, \"You [believers] are but falsifiers.\"\n\n**59** (59) Thus does All?h seal the hearts of those who do not know.[1156]\n\n**6** (6) [It is] the promise of All?h. All?h does not fail in His promise, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**60** (60) So be patient. Indeed, the promise of All?h is truth. And let them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith].\n\n**7** (7) They know what is apparent of the worldly life, but they, of the Hereafter, are unaware.\n\n**8** (8) Do they not contemplate within themselves?[1142] All?h has not created the heavens and the earth and what is between them except in truth and for a specified term. And indeed, many of the people, in the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers.\n\n**9** (9) Have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? They were greater than them in power, and they plowed [or excavated] the earth and built it up more than they [i.e., the Makkans] have built it up, and their messengers came to them with clear evidences. And All?h would not ever have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves."

And We sent down rain from the sky and made grow therein [plants] of every noble kind.\n\n**11** (11) This is the creation of All?h. So show Me what those other than Him have created. Rather, the wrongdoers are in clear error.\n\n**12** (12) And We had certainly given Luqm?n wisdom [and said], \"Be grateful to All?h.\" And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies [His favor] - then indeed, All?h is Free of need and Praiseworthy.\n\n**13** (13) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Luqm?n said to his son while he was instructing him, \"O my son, do not associate [anything] with All?h. Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice.\"\n\n**14** (14) And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years. Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the [final] destination.\n\n**15** (15) But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge,[1161] do not obey them but accompany them in [this] world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me [in repentance]. Then to Me will be your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do.\n\n**16** (16) [And Luqm?n said], \"O my son, indeed if it [i.e., a wrong] should be the weight of a mustard seed and should be within a rock or [anywhere] in the heavens or in the earth, All?h will bring it forth. Indeed, All?h is Subtle[1162] and Aware.\n\n**17** (17) O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] resolve.[1163]\n\n**18** (18) And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people[1164] and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, All?h does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful.\n\n**19** (19) And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys.\"\n\n**2** (2) These are verses of the wise[1159] Book,\n\n**20** (20) Do you not see that All?h has made subject to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and amply bestowed upon you His favors, [both] apparent and unapparent? But of the people is he who disputes about All?h without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book [from Him].\n\n**21** (21) And when it is said to them, \"Follow what All?h has revealed,\" they say, \"Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers.\" Even if Satan was inviting them to the punishment of the Blaze?\n\n**22** (22) And whoever submits his face [i.e., self] to All?h while he is a doer of good - then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And to All?h will be the outcome of [all] matters.\n\n**23** (23) And whoever has disbelieved - let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**24** (24) We grant them enjoyment for a little; then We will force them to a massive punishment.\n\n**25** (25) And if you asked them, \"Who created the heavens and earth?\" they would surely say, \"All?h.\" Say, \"[All] praise is [due] to All?h\"; but most of them do not know.\n\n**26** (26) To All?h belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth. Indeed, All?h is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**27** (27) And if whatever trees upon the earth were pens and the sea [was ink], replenished thereafter by seven [more] seas, the words[1165] of All?h would not be exhausted. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**28** (28) Your creation and your resurrection will not be but as that of a single soul.[1166] Indeed, All?h is Hearing and Seeing.\n\n**29** (29) Do you not see [i.e., know] that All?h causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term, and that All?h, of whatever you do, is Aware?\n\n**3** (3) As guidance and mercy for the doers of good\n\n**30** (30) That is because All?h is the True Reality, and that what they call upon[1167] other than Him is falsehood, and because All?h is the Most High, the Grand.\n\n**31** (31) Do you not see that ships sail through the sea by the favor of All?h that He may show you of His signs? Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.\n\n**32** (32) And when waves come over them like canopies, they supplicate All?h, sincere to Him in religion [i.e., faith]. But when He delivers them to the land, there are [some] of them who are moderate [in faith]. And none rejects Our signs except everyone treacherous and ungrateful.\n\n**33** (33) O mankind, fear your Lord and fear a Day when no father will avail his son, nor will a son avail his father at all. Indeed, the promise of All?h is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about All?h by the Deceiver [i.e., Satan].\n\n**34** (34) Indeed, All?h [alone] has knowledge of the Hour and sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs.[1168] And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, All?h is Knowing and Aware.\n\n**4** (4) Who establish prayer and give zak?h, and they, of the Hereafter, are certain [in faith].\n\n**5** (5) Those are on [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.\n\n**6** (6) And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech[1160] to mislead [others] from the way of All?h without knowledge and who takes it [i.e., His way] in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment.\n\n**7** (7) And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them, as if there was in his ears deafness. So give him tidings of a painful punishment.\n\n**8** (8) Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them are the Gardens of Pleasure,\n\n**9** (9) Wherein they abide eternally; [it is] the promise of All?h [which is] truth.

Indeed We, from the criminals, will take retribution.\n\n**23** (23) And We certainly gave Moses the Scripture, so do not be in doubt over his meeting.[1176] And We made it [i.e., the Torah] guidance for the Children of Israel.\n\n**24** (24) And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient and [when] they were certain of Our signs.\n\n**25** (25) Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\n\n**26** (26) Has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them, [as] they walk among their dwellings?

They did not intend except to flee.\n\n**14** (14) And if they had been entered upon from all its [surrounding] regions and fitnah [i.e., disbelief] had been demanded of them, they would have done it and not hesitated over it except briefly.\n\n**15** (15) And they had already promised All?h before not to turn their backs [i.e., flee]. And ever is the promise to All?h [that about which one will be] questioned.\n\n**16** (16) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Never will fleeing benefit you if you should flee from death or killing; and then [if you did], you would not be given enjoyment [of life] except for a little.\"\n\n**17** (17) Say, \"Who is it that can protect you from All?h[1186] if He intends for you an ill or intends for you a mercy?\" And they will not find for themselves besides All?h any protector or any helper.\n\n**18** (18) Already All?h knows the hinderers[1187] among you and those [hypocrites] who say to their brothers, \"Come to us,\"[1188] and do not go to battle, except for a few,[1189]\n\n**19** (19) Indisposed[1190] toward you. And when fear comes, you see them looking at you, their eyes revolving like one being overcome by death. But when fear departs, they lash you with sharp tongues, indisposed toward [any] good. Those have not believed, so All?h has rendered their deeds worthless, and ever is that, for All?h, easy.\n\n**2** (2) And follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed All?h is ever, of what you do, Aware.\n\n**20** (20) They think the companies have not [yet] withdrawn.[1191] And if the companies should come [again], they would wish they were in the desert among the bedouins, inquiring [from afar] about your news. And if they should be among you, they would not fight except for a little.\n\n**21** (21) There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of All?h an excellent pattern[1192] for anyone whose hope is in All?h and the Last Day and [who] remembers All?h often.\n\n**22** (22) And when the believers saw the companies, they said, \"This is what All?h and His Messenger had promised us, and All?h and His Messenger spoke the truth.\" And it increased them only in faith and acceptance.\n\n**23** (23) Among the believers are men true to what they promised All?h. Among them is he who has fulfilled his vow [to the death], and among them is he who awaits [his chance]. And they did not alter [the terms of their commitment] by any alteration -\n\n**24** (24) That All?h may reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance. Indeed, All?h is ever Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**25** (25) And All?h repelled those who disbelieved, in their rage, not having obtained any good. And sufficient was All?h for the believers in battle, and ever is All?h Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n\n**26** (26) And He brought down those who supported them among the People of the Scripture[1193] from their fortresses and cast terror into their hearts [so that] a party [i.e., their men] you killed, and you took captive a party [i.e., the women and children].\n\n**27** (27) And He caused you to inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land which you have not trodden.[1194] And ever is All?h, over all things, competent.\n\n**28** (28) O Prophet, say to your wives, \"If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release.\n\n**29** (29) But if you should desire All?h and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter - then indeed, All?h has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward.\"\n\n**3** (3) And rely upon All?h; and sufficient is All?h as Disposer of affairs.[1179]\n\n**30** (30) O wives of the Prophet, whoever of you should commit a clear immorality - for her the punishment would be doubled two fold, and ever is that, for All?h, easy.\n\n**31** (31) And whoever of you devoutly obeys All?h and His Messenger and does righteousness - We will give her her reward twice; and We have prepared for her a noble provision.\n\n**32** (32) O wives of the Prophet, you are not like anyone among women. If you fear All?h, then do not be soft in speech [to men],[1195] lest he in whose heart is disease should covet, but speak with appropriate speech.\n\n**33** (33) And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves as [was] the display of the former times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zak?h and obey All?h and His Messenger. All?h intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification.\n\n**34** (34) And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of All?h and wisdom.[1196] Indeed, All?h is ever Subtle[1197] and Aware.\n\n**35** (35) Indeed, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember All?h often and the women who do so - for them All?h has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.\n\n**36** (36) It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when All?h and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair. And whoever disobeys All?h and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.\n\n**37** (37) And [remember, O Mu?ammad], when you said to the one on whom All?h bestowed favor and you bestowed favor,[1198] \"Keep your wife and fear All?h,\" while you concealed within yourself that which All?h is to disclose.[1199] And you feared the people,[1200] while All?h has more right that you fear Him.[1201] So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort [i.e., guilt] concerning the wives of their claimed [i.e., adopted] sons when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command [i.e., decree] of All?h accomplished.\n\n**38** (38) There is not to be upon the Prophet any discomfort concerning that which All?h has imposed upon him.[1202] [This is] the established way of All?h with those [prophets] who have passed on before. And ever is the command of All?h a destiny decreed.\n\n**39** (39) [All?h praises] those who convey the messages of All?h[1203] and fear Him and do not fear anyone but All?h. And sufficient is All?h as Accountant.\n\n**4** (4) All?h has not made for a man two hearts in his interior. And He has not made your wives whom you declare unlawful[1180] your mothers. And He has not made your claimed [i.e., adopted] sons your [true] sons. That is [merely] your saying by your mouths, but All?h says the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.\n\n**40** (40) Mu?ammad is not the father of [any] one of your men, but [he is] the Messenger of All?h and seal [i.e., last] of the prophets. And ever is All?h, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**41** (41) O you who have believed, remember All?h with much remembrance\n\n**42** (42) And exalt Him morning and afternoon.\n\n**43** (43) It is He who confers blessing upon you,[1204] and His angels [ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful.\n\n**44** (44) Their greeting the Day they meet Him will be, \"Peace.\" And He has prepared for them a noble reward.\n\n**45** (45) O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner\n\n**46** (46) And one who invites to All?h, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp.\n\n**47** (47) And give good tidings to the believers that they will have from All?h great bounty.\n\n**48** (48) And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and disregard their annoyance, and rely upon All?h. And sufficient is All?h as Disposer of affairs.\n\n**49** (49) O you who have believed, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them [i.e., consummated the marriage], then there is not for you any waiting period to count concerning them. So provide for them and give them a gracious release.\n\n**5** (5) Call them[1181] by [the names of] their fathers; it is more just in the sight of All?h. But if you do not know their fathers - then they are [still] your brothers in religion and those entrusted to you. And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred but [only for] what your hearts intended. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**50** (50) O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their due compensation[1205] and those your right hand possesses from what All?h has returned to you [of captives] and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet [and] if the Prophet wishes to marry her; [this is] only for you, excluding the [other] believers. We certainly know what We have made obligatory upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess, [but this is for you] in order that there will be upon you no discomfort [i.e., difficulty]. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**51** (51) You, [O Mu?ammad], may put aside whom you will of them[1206] or take to yourself whom you will. And any that you desire of those [wives] from whom you had [temporarily] separated - there is no blame upon you [in returning her]. That is more suitable that they should be content and not grieve and that they should be satisfied with what you have given them - all of them. And All?h knows what is in your hearts. And ever is All?h Knowing and Forbearing.\n\n**52** (52) Not lawful to you, [O Mu?ammad], are [any additional] women after [this], nor [is it] for you to exchange them for [other] wives, even if their beauty were to please you, except what your right hand possesses. And ever is All?h, over all things, an Observer.[1207]\n\n**53** (53) O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse without seeking to remain for conversation. Indeed, that [behavior] was troubling the Prophet, and he is shy of [dismissing] you. But All?h is not shy of the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not [conceivable or lawful] for you to harm the Messenger of All?h or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of All?h an enormity.\n\n**54** (54) Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, indeed All?h is ever, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**55** (55) There is no blame upon them [i.e., women] concerning their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons or their women or those their right hands possess [i.e., slaves].[1208] And fear All?h. Indeed All?h is ever, over all things, Witness.\n\n**56** (56) Indeed, All?h confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [All?h to confer] blessing upon him and ask [All?h to grant him] peace.\n\n**57** (57) Indeed, those who abuse All?h and His Messenger - All?h has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and prepared for them a humiliating punishment.\n\n**58** (58) And those who harm believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned [i.e., deserved] have certainly borne upon themselves a slander and manifest sin.\n\n**59** (59) O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments.[1209] That is more suitable that they will be known[1210] and not be abused. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.[1211]\n\n**6** (6) The Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves,[1182] and his wives are [in the position of] their mothers. And those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance] in the decree of All?h than the [other] believers and the emigrants, except that you may do to your close associates a kindness [through bequest]. That was in the Book[1183] inscribed.\n\n**60** (60) If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease[1212] and those who spread rumors in al-Mad?nah do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little,\n\n**61** (61) Accursed wherever they are found, [being] seized and massacred completely.\n\n**62** (62) [This is] the established way of All?h with those who passed on before; and you will not find in the way of All?h any change.\n\n**63** (63) People ask you concerning the Hour. Say, \"Knowledge of it is only with All?h. And what may make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.\"\n\n**64** (64) Indeed, All?h has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze.\n\n**65** (65) Abiding therein forever, they will not find a protector or a helper.\n\n**66** (66) The Day their faces will be turned about in the Fire, they will say, \"How we wish we had obeyed All?h and obeyed the Messenger.\"\n\n**67** (67) And they will say, \"Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries,[1213] and they led us astray from the [right] way.\n\n**68** (68) Our Lord, give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse.\"\n\n**69** (69) O you who have believed, be not like those who abused Moses; then All?h cleared him of what they said. And he, in the sight of All?h, was distinguished.\n\n**7** (7) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary; and We took from them a solemn covenant\n\n**70** (70) O you who have believed, fear All?h and speak words of appropriate justice.\n\n**71** (71) He will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys All?h and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.\n\n**72** (72) Indeed, We offered the Trust[1214] to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man [undertook to] bear it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant.[1215]\n\n**73** (73) [It[1216] was] so that All?h may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the men and women who associate others with Him and that All?h may accept repentance from the believing men and believing women. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**8** (8) That He may question the truthful about their truth.[1184] And He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.\n\n**9** (9) O you who have believed, remember the favor of All?h upon you when armies came to [attack] you and We sent upon them a wind and armies [of angels] you did not see. And ever is All?h, of what you do, Seeing."

    "content": "**1** (1) [All] praise is [due] to All?h, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and to Him belongs [all] praise in the Hereafter. And He is the Wise, the Aware.\n\n**10** (10) And We certainly gave David from Us bounty. [We said], \"O mountains, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as well].\" And We made pliable for him iron,\n\n**11** (11) [Commanding him], \"Make full coats of mail and calculate [precisely] the links, and work [all of you] righteousness. Indeed I, of what you do, am Seeing.\"\n\n**12** (12) And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind - its morning [journey was that of] a month - and its afternoon [journey was that of] a month, and We made flow for him a spring of [liquid] copper. And among the jinn were those who worked for him by the permission of his Lord. And whoever deviated among them from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze.\n\n**13** (13) They made for him what he willed of elevated chambers,[1220] statues,[1221] bowls like reservoirs, and stationary kettles. [We said], \"Work, O family of David, in gratitude.\" And few of My servants are grateful.\n\n**14** (14) And when We decreed for him [i.e., Solomon] death, nothing indicated to them [i.e., the jinn] his death except a creature of the earth eating his staff.[1222] But when he fell, it became clear to the jinn that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment.[1223]\n\n**15** (15) There was for [the tribe of] Saba� in their dwelling place a sign: two [fields of] gardens on the right and on the left. [They were told], \"Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord.\"\n\n**16** (16) But they turned away [refusing], so We sent upon them the flood of the dam,[1224] and We replaced their two [fields of] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit, tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees.\n\n**17** (17) [By] that We repaid them because they disbelieved. And do We [thus] repay except the ungrateful?\n\n**18** (18) And We placed between them and the cities which We had blessed[1225] [many] visible cities. And We determined between them the [distances of] journey,[1226] [saying], \"Travel between them by night or by day in safety.\"\n\n**19** (19) But [insolently] they said, \"Our Lord, lengthen the distance between our journeys,\" and wronged themselves, so We made them narrations[1227] and dispersed them in total dispersion. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.\n\n**2** (2) He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.\n\n**20** (20) And Iblees had already confirmed through them[1228] his assumption,[1229] so they followed him, except for a party of believers.\n\n**21** (21) And he had over them no authority except [it was decreed] that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is thereof in doubt. And your Lord, over all things, is Guardian.[1230]\n\n**22** (22) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Invoke those you claim [as deities] besides All?h.\" They do not possess an atom's weight [of ability] in the heavens or on the earth, and they do not have therein any partnership [with Him], nor is there for Him from among them any assistant.\n\n**23** (23) And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits. [And those wait] until, when terror is removed from their hearts,[1231] they will say [to one another], \"What has your Lord said?\" They will say, \"The truth.\" And He is the Most High, the Grand.\n\n**24** (24) Say, \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"All?h. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error.\"\n\n**25** (25) Say, \"You will not be asked about what we committed, and we will not be asked about what you do.\"\n\n**26** (26) Say, \"Our Lord will bring us together; then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Knowing Judge.\"[1232]\n\n**27** (27) Say, \"Show me those whom you have attached to Him as partners. No! Rather, He [alone] is All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\n**28** (28) And We have not sent you except comprehensively[1233] to mankind as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of the people do not know.\n\n**29** (29) And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**3** (3) But those who disbelieve say, \"The Hour will not come to us.\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you. [All?h is] the Knower of the unseen.\" Not absent from Him is an atom's weight[1218] within the heavens or within the earth or [what is] smaller than that or greater, except that it is in a clear register -\n\n**30** (30) Say, \"For you is the appointment of a Day [when] you will not remain thereafter an hour, nor will you precede [it].\"\n\n**31** (31) And those who disbelieve say, \"We will never believe in this Qur�?n nor in that before it.\" But if you could see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, refuting each others' words...[1234] Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, \"If not for you, we would have been believers.\"\n\n**32** (32) Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, \"Did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you were criminals.\"\n\n**33** (33) Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, \"Rather, [it was your] conspiracy of night and day when you were ordering us to disbelieve in All?h and attribute to Him equals.\" But they will [all] confide regret when they see the punishment; and We will put shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. Will they be recompensed except for what they used to do?\n\n**34** (34) And We did not send into a city any warner except that its affluent said, \"Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers.\"\n\n**35** (35) And they[1235] said, \"We are more [than the believers] in wealth and children, and we are not to be punished.\"\n\n**36** (36) Say, \"Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it], but most of the people do not know.\"\n\n**37** (37) And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us in position, but it is [by being] one who has believed and done righteousness. For them there will be the double reward for what they did, and they will be in the upper chambers [of Paradise], safe [and secure].\n\n**38** (38) And the ones who strive against Our verses to cause [them] failure[1236] - those will be brought into the punishment [to remain].\n\n**39** (39) Say, \"Indeed, my Lord extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts [it] for him. But whatever thing you spend [in His cause] - He will compensate it; and He is the best of providers.\"\n\n**4** (4) That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness and noble provision.\n\n**40** (40) And [mention] the Day when He will gather them all and then say to the angels, \"Did these [people] used to worship you?\"\n\n**41** (41) They will say, \"Exalted are You! You, [O All?h], are our benefactor excluding [i.e., not] them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them.\"\n\n**42** (42) But today [i.e., the Day of Judgement] you do not hold for one another [the power of] benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged, \"Taste the punishment of the Fire, which you used to deny.\"\n\n**43** (43) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, they say, \"This is not but a man who wishes to avert you from that which your fathers were worshipping.\" And they say, \"This is not except a lie invented.\" And those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, \"This is not but obvious magic.\"\n\n**44** (44) And We had not given them any scriptures which they could study, and We had not sent to them before you, [O Mu?ammad], any warner.\n\n**45** (45) And those before them denied, and they [i.e., the people of Makkah] have not attained a tenth of what We had given them. But they [i.e., the former peoples] denied My messengers, so how [terrible] was My reproach.\n\n**46** (46) Say, \"I only advise you of one [thing] - that you stand for All?h, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.\" There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment.\n\n**47** (47) Say, \"Whatever payment I might have asked of you - it is yours. My payment is only from All?h, and He is, over all things, Witness.\"\n\n**48** (48) Say, \"Indeed, my Lord projects the truth, Knower of the unseen.\"\n\n**49** (49) Say, \"The truth has come, and falsehood can neither begin [anything] nor repeat [it].\"[1237]\n\n**5** (5) But those who strive against Our verses [seeking] to cause failure[1219] - for them will be a painful punishment of foul nature.\n\n**50** (50) Say, \"If I should err, I would only err against myself. But if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is Hearing and near.\"\n\n**51** (51) And if you could see[1238] when they are terrified but there is no escape, and they will be seized from a place nearby.\n\n**52** (52) And they will [then] say, \"We believe in it!\" But how for them will be the taking[1239] [of faith] from a place far away?[1240]\n\n**53** (53) And they had already disbelieved in it before and would assault[1241] the unseen from a place far away.[1242]\n\n**54** (54) And prevention will be placed between them and what they desire,[1243] as was done with their kind before. Indeed, they were in disquieting doubt [i.e., denial].\n\n**6** (6) And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, and it guides to the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**7** (7) But those who disbelieve say, \"Shall we direct you to a man who will inform you [that] when you have disintegrated in complete disintegration, you will [then] be [recreated] in a new creation?\n\n**8** (8) Has he invented about All?h a lie or is there in him madness?\" Rather, they who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in the punishment and [are in] extreme error.\n\n**9** (9) Then, do they not look at what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and earth? If We should will, We could cause the earth to swallow them or [could] let fall upon them fragments from the sky. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant turning back [to All?h]."

He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**10** (10) Whoever desires honor [through power] - then to All?h belongs all honor.[1245] To Him ascends good speech, and righteous work raises it.[1246] But they who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment, and the plotting of those - it will perish.\n\n**11** (11) And All?h created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop; then He made you mates. And no female conceives nor does she give birth except with His knowledge. And no aged person is granted [additional] life nor is his lifespan lessened but that it is in a register. Indeed, that for All?h is easy.\n\n**12** (12) And not alike are the two seas [i.e., bodies of water]. One is fresh and sweet, palatable for drinking, and one is salty and bitter. And from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear, and you see the ships plowing through [them] that you might seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**13** (13) He causes the night to enter the day, and He causes the day to enter the night and has subjected the sun and the moon - each running [its course] for a specified term. That is All?h, your Lord; to Him belongs sovereignty. And those whom you invoke other than Him do not possess [as much as] the membrane of a date seed.\n\n**14** (14) If you invoke them, they do not hear your supplication; and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association.[1247] And none can inform you like [one] Aware [of all matters].\n\n**15** (15) O mankind, you are those in need of All?h, while All?h is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**16** (16) If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation.\n\n**17** (17) And that is for All?h not difficult.\n\n**18** (18) And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if a heavily laden soul calls [another] to [carry some of] its load, nothing of it will be carried, even if he should be a close relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and have established prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for [the benefit of] his soul. And to All?h is the [final] destination.\n\n**19** (19) Not equal are the blind and the seeing,\n\n**2** (2) Whatever All?h grants to people of mercy - none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds - none can release it thereafter. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**20** (20) Nor are the darknesses and the light,\n\n**21** (21) Nor are the shade and the heat,[1248]\n\n**22** (22) And not equal are the living and the dead. Indeed, All?h causes to hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves.[1249]\n\n**23** (23) You, [O Mu?ammad], are not but a warner.\n\n**24** (24) Indeed, We have sent you with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that there had passed within it a warner.\n\n**25** (25) And if they deny you - then already have those before them denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and written ordinances and with the enlightening Scripture.\n\n**26** (26) Then I seized the ones who disbelieved, and how [terrible] was My reproach.\n\n**27** (27) Do you not see that All?h sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And in the mountains are tracts, white and red of varying shades and [some] extremely black.\n\n**28** (28) And among people and moving creatures and grazing livestock are various colors similarly. Only those fear All?h, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, All?h is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.\n\n**29** (29) Indeed, those who recite the Book of All?h and establish prayer and spend [in His cause] out of what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, [can] expect a transaction [i.e., profit] that will never perish -\n\n**3** (3) O mankind, remember the favor of All?h upon you. Is there any creator other than All?h who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?\n\n**30** (30) That He may give them in full their rewards and increase for them of His bounty. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Appreciative.[1250]\n\n**31** (31) And that which We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], of the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it. Indeed All?h, of His servants, is Aware and Seeing.\n\n**32** (32) Then We caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants;[1251] and among them is he who wrongs himself [i.e., sins], and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of All?h. That [inheritance] is what is the great bounty.\n\n**33** (33) [For them are] gardens of perpetual residence which they will enter. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be silk.\n\n**34** (34) And they will say, \"Praise to All?h, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative -\n\n**35** (35) He who has settled us in the home of duration [i.e., Paradise] out of His bounty. There touches us not in it any fatigue, and there touches us not in it weariness [of mind].\"\n\n**36** (36) And for those who disbelieve will be the fire of Hell. [Death] is not decreed for them[1252] so they may die, nor will its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We recompense every ungrateful one.\n\n**37** (37) And they will cry out therein, \"Our Lord, remove us;[1253] we will do righteousness - other than what we were doing!\" But did We not grant you life enough for whoever would remember therein to remember, and the warner had come to you? So taste [the punishment], for there is not for the wrongdoers any helper.\n\n**38** (38) Indeed, All?h is Knower of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**39** (39) It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves - upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them in the sight of their Lord except in hatred; and the disbelief of the disbelievers does not increase them except in loss.\n\n**4** (4) And if they deny you, [O Mu?ammad] - already were messengers denied before you. And to All?h are returned [all] matters.\n\n**40** (40) Say, \"Have you considered[1254] your 'partners' whom you invoke besides All?h? Show me what they have created from the earth, or have they partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a book so they are [standing] on evidence therefrom? [No], rather, the wrongdoers do not promise each other except delusion.\"[1255]\n\n**41** (41) Indeed, All?h holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease. And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing[1256] and Forgiving.\n\n**42** (42) And they swore by All?h their strongest oaths that if a warner came to them, they would be more guided than [any] one of the [previous] nations. But when a warner came to them, it did not increase them except in aversion\n\n**43** (43) [Due to] arrogance in the land and plotting of evil; but the evil plot does not encompass except its own people. Then do they await except the way [i.e., fate] of the former peoples? But you will never find in the way [i.e., established method] of All?h any change, and you will never find in the way of All?h[1257] any alteration.[1258]\n\n**44** (44) Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? And they were greater than them in power. But All?h is not to be caused failure [i.e., prevented] by anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is ever Knowing and Competent.\n\n**45** (45) And if All?h were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned, He would not leave upon it [i.e., the earth] any creature. But He defers them for a specified term. And when their time comes, then indeed All?h has ever been, of His servants, Seeing.\n\n**5** (5) O mankind, indeed the promise of All?h is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about All?h by the Deceiver [i.e., Satan].\n\n**6** (6) Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you; so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze.\n\n**7** (7) Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment, and those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and great reward.\n\n**8** (8) Then is one to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he considers it good [like one rightly guided]? For indeed, All?h sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Indeed, All?h is Knowing of what they do.\n\n**9** (9) And it is All?h who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and give life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection."

So give him good tidings of forgiveness and noble reward.\n\n**12** (12) Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life and record what they have put forth and what they left behind, and all things We have enumerated in a clear register.\n\n**13** (13) And present to them an example: the people of the city, when the messengers came to it -\n\n**14** (14) When We sent to them two but they denied them, so We strengthened [them] with a third, and they said, \"Indeed, we are messengers to you.\"\n\n**15** (15) They said, \"You are not but human beings like us, and the Most Merciful has not revealed a thing. You are only telling lies.\"\n\n**16** (16) They said, \"Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you,\n\n**17** (17) And we are not responsible except for clear notification.\"\n\n**18** (18) They said, \"Indeed, we consider you a bad omen. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you, and there will surely touch you, from us, a painful punishment.\"\n\n**19** (19) They said, \"Your omen [i.e., fate] is with yourselves. Is it[1262] because you were reminded? Rather, you are a transgressing people.\"\n\n**2** (2) By the wise[1261] Qur�?n,\n\n**20** (20) And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running. He said, \"O my people, follow the messengers.\n\n**21** (21) Follow those who do not ask of you [any] payment, and they are [rightly] guided.\n\n**22** (22) And why should I not worship He who created me and to whom you will be returned?\n\n**23** (23) Should I take other than Him [false] deities [while], if the Most Merciful intends for me some adversity, their intercession will not avail me at all, nor can they save me?\n\n**24** (24) Indeed, I would then be in manifest error.\n\n**25** (25) Indeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me.\"\n\n**26** (26) It was said, \"Enter Paradise.\"[1263] He said, \"I wish my people could know\n\n**27** (27) Of how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored.\"\n\n**28** (28) And We did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven, nor would We have done so.\n\n**29** (29) It was not but one shout,[1264] and immediately they were extinguished.\n\n**3** (3) Indeed you, [O Mu?ammad], are from among the messengers,\n\n**30** (30) How regretful for the servants. There did not come to them any messenger except that they used to ridicule him.\n\n**31** (31) Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them - that they to them[1265] will not return?\n\n**32** (32) And indeed, all of them will yet be brought present before Us.\n\n**33** (33) And a sign for them is the dead earth. We have brought it to life and brought forth from it grain, and from it they eat.\n\n**34** (34) And We placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines and caused to burst forth therefrom some springs -\n\n**35** (35) That they may eat of His fruit.[1266] And their hands have not produced it,[1267] so will they not be grateful?\n\n**36** (36) Exalted is He who created all pairs[1268] - from what the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know.\n\n**37** (37) And a sign for them is the night. We remove[1269] from it the [light of] day, so they are [left] in darkness.\n\n**38** (38) And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\n\n**39** (39) And the moon - We have determined for it phases, until it returns [appearing] like the old date stalk.\n\n**4** (4) On a straight path.\n\n**40** (40) It is not allowable [i.e., possible] for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming.\n\n**41** (41) And a sign for them is that We carried their forefathers[1270] in a laden ship.\n\n**42** (42) And We created for them from the likes of it that which they ride.\n\n**43** (43) And if We should will, We could drown them; then no one responding to a cry would there be for them, nor would they be saved\n\n**44** (44) Except as a mercy from Us and provision for a time.\n\n**45** (45) But when it is said to them, \"Beware of what is before you and what is behind you;[1271] perhaps you will receive mercy...\"[1272]\n\n**46** (46) And no sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they are from it turning away.\n\n**47** (47) And when it is said to them, \"Spend from that which All?h has provided for you,\" those who disbelieve say to those who believe, \"Should we feed one whom, if All?h had willed, He would have fed? You are not but in clear error.\"\n\n**48** (48) And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**49** (49) They do not await except one blast[1273] which will seize them while they are disputing.\n\n**5** (5) [This is] a revelation of the Exalted in Might, the Merciful,\n\n**50** (50) And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.\n\n**51** (51) And the Horn will be blown;[1274] and at once from the graves to their Lord they will hasten.\n\n**52** (52) They will say, \"O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?\" [The reply will be], \"This is what the Most Merciful had promised, and the messengers told the truth.\"\n\n**53** (53) It will not be but one blast, and at once they are all brought present before Us.\n\n**54** (54) So today [i.e., the Day of Judgement] no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do.\n\n**55** (55) Indeed the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be amused in [joyful] occupation -\n\n**56** (56) They and their spouses - in shade, reclining on adorned couches.\n\n**57** (57) For them therein is fruit, and for them is whatever they request [or wish]\n\n**58** (58) [And] \"Peace,\" a word from a Merciful Lord.\n\n**59** (59) [Then He will say], \"But stand apart today, you criminals.[1275]\n\n**6** (6) That you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware.\n\n**60** (60) Did I not enjoin upon you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - [for] indeed, he is to you a clear enemy -\n\n**61** (61) And that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path.\n\n**62** (62) And he had already led astray from among you much of creation, so did you not use reason?\n\n**63** (63) This is the Hellfire which you were promised.\n\n**64** (64) [Enter to] burn therein today for what you used to deny.\"[1276]\n\n**65** (65) That Day, We will seal over their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn.\n\n**66** (66) And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, and they would race to [find] the path, and how could they see?[1277]\n\n**67** (67) And if We willed, We could have deformed them, [paralyzing them] in their places so they would not be able to proceed, nor could they return.[1278]\n\n**68** (68) And he to whom We grant long life We reverse in creation;[1279] so will they not understand?\n\n**69** (69) And We did not give him [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] knowledge of poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur�?n\n\n**7** (7) Already the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe.\n\n**70** (70) To warn whoever is alive[1280] and justify the word [i.e., decree] against the disbelievers.\n\n**71** (71) Do they not see that We have created for them from what Our hands[1281] have made, grazing livestock, and [then] they are their owners?\n\n**72** (72) And We have tamed them for them, so some of them they ride, and some of them they eat.\n\n**73** (73) And for them therein are [other] benefits and drinks, so will they not be grateful?\n\n**74** (74) But they have taken besides All?h [false] deities that perhaps they would be helped.\n\n**75** (75) They are not able to help them, and they [themselves] are for them soldiers in attendance.[1282]\n\n**76** (76) So let not their speech grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.\n\n**77** (77) Does man not consider that We created him from a [mere] sperm-drop - then at once[1283] he is a clear adversary?\n\n**78** (78) And he presents for Us an example[1284] and forgets his [own] creation. He says, \"Who will give life to bones while they are disintegrated?\"\n\n**79** (79) Say, \"He will give them life who produced them the first time; and He is, of all creation, Knowing.\"\n\n**8** (8) Indeed, We have put shackles on their necks, and they are to their chins, so they are with heads [kept] aloft.\n\n**80** (80) [It is] He who made for you from the green tree, fire, and then from it you ignite.\n\n**81** (81) Is not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them? Yes, [it is so]; and He is the Knowing Creator.\n\n**82** (82) His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n**83** (83) So exalted is He in whose hand is the realm of all things, and to Him you will be returned.\n\n**9** (9) And We have put before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them, so they do not see."

But among their descendants is the doer of good and the clearly unjust to himself [i.e., sinner].\n\n**114** (114) And We did certainly confer favor upon Moses and Aaron.\n\n**115** (115) And We saved them and their people from the great affliction,\n\n**116** (116) And We supported them so it was they who overcame.\n\n**117** (117) And We gave them the explicit Scripture [i.e., the Torah],\n\n**118** (118) And We guided them on the straight path.\n\n**119** (119) And We left for them [favorable mention] among later generations:\n\n**12** (12) But you wonder, while they mock,\n\n**120** (120) \"Peace upon Moses and Aaron.\"\n\n**121** (121) Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.\n\n**122** (122) Indeed, they were of Our believing servants.\n\n**123** (123) And indeed, Elias was from among the messengers,\n\n**124** (124) When he said to his people, \"Will you not fear All?h?\n\n**125** (125) Do you call upon Ba?l[1300] and leave the best of creators -\n\n**126** (126) All?h, your Lord and the Lord of your first forefathers?\"\n\n**127** (127) And they denied him, so indeed, they will be brought [for punishment],\n\n**128** (128) Except the chosen servants of All?h.\n\n**129** (129) And We left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:\n\n**13** (13) And when they are reminded, they remember not.\n\n**130** (130) \"Peace upon Elias.\"[1301]\n\n**131** (131) Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.\n\n**132** (132) Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.\n\n**133** (133) And indeed, Lot was among the messengers.\n\n**134** (134) [So mention] when We saved him and his family, all,\n\n**135** (135) Except an old woman [i.e., his wife] among those who remained [with the evildoers].\n\n**136** (136) Then We destroyed the others.\n\n**137** (137) And indeed, you pass by them in the morning\n\n**138** (138) And at night. Then will you not use reason?\n\n**139** (139) And indeed, Jonah was among the messengers.\n\n**14** (14) And when they see a sign, they ridicule.\n\n**140** (140) [Mention] when he ran away to the laden ship.\n\n**141** (141) And he drew lots[1302] and was among the losers.\n\n**142** (142) Then the fish swallowed him, while he was blameworthy.[1303]\n\n**143** (143) And had he not been of those who exalt All?h,\n\n**144** (144) He would have remained inside its belly until the Day they are resurrected.[1304]\n\n**145** (145) But We threw him onto the open shore while he was ill.\n\n**146** (146) And We caused to grow over him a gourd vine.[1305]\n\n**147** (147) And We sent him[1306] to [his people of] a hundred thousand or more.\n\n**148** (148) And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment [of life] for a time.\n\n**149** (149) So inquire of them, [O Mu?ammad], \"Does your Lord have daughters while they have sons?[1307]\n\n**15** (15) And say, \"This is not but obvious magic.\n\n**150** (150) Or did We create the angels as females while they were witnesses?\"\n\n**151** (151) Unquestionably, it is out of their [invented] falsehood that they say,\n\n**152** (152) \"All?h has begotten,\" and indeed, they are liars.\n\n**153** (153) Has He chosen daughters over sons?\n\n**154** (154) What is [wrong] with you? How do you make judgement?\n\n**155** (155) Then will you not be reminded?\n\n**156** (156) Or do you have a clear authority?[1308]\n\n**157** (157) Then produce your scripture, if you should be truthful.\n\n**158** (158) And they have made [i.e., claimed] between Him and the jinn a lineage, but the jinn have already known that they [who made such claims] will be brought [to punishment].\n\n**159** (159) Exalted is All?h above what they describe,\n\n**16** (16) When we have died and become dust and bones, are we indeed to be resurrected?\n\n**160** (160) Except the chosen servants of All?h [who do not share in that sin].\n\n**161** (161) So indeed, you [disbelievers] and whatever you worship,\n\n**162** (162) You cannot tempt [anyone] away from Him\n\n**163** (163) Except he who is to [enter and] burn in the Hellfire.[1309]\n\n**164** (164) [The angels say],[1310] \"There is not among us any except that he has a known position.[1311]\n\n**165** (165) And indeed, we are those who line up [for prayer].\n\n**166** (166) And indeed, we are those who exalt All?h.\"\n\n**167** (167) And indeed, they [i.e., the disbelievers] used to say,[1312]\n\n**168** (168) \"If we had a message from [those of] the former peoples,\n\n**169** (169) We would have been the chosen servants of All?h.\"\n\n**17** (17) And our forefathers [as well]?\"\n\n**170** (170) But they disbelieved in it,[1313] so they are going to know.\n\n**171** (171) And Our word [i.e., decree] has already preceded for Our servants, the messengers,\n\n**172** (172) [That] indeed, they would be those given victory\n\n**173** (173) And [that] indeed, Our soldiers [i.e., the believers] will be those who overcome.[1314]\n\n**174** (174) So, [O Mu?ammad], leave them for a time.\n\n**175** (175) And see [what will befall] them, for they are going to see.\n\n**176** (176) Then for Our punishment are they impatient?\n\n**177** (177) But when it descends in their territory, then evil is the morning of those who were warned.\n\n**178** (178) And leave them for a time.\n\n**179** (179) And see, for they are going to see.\n\n**18** (18) Say, \"Yes, and you will be [rendered] contemptible.\"\n\n**180** (180) Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might, above what they describe.\n\n**181** (181) And peace upon the messengers.\n\n**182** (182) And praise to All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**19** (19) It will be only one shout, and at once they will be observing.\n\n**2** (2) And those who drive [the clouds]\n\n**20** (20) They will say, \"O woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense.\"\n\n**21** (21) [They will be told], \"This is the Day of Judgement which you used to deny.\"\n\n**22** (22) [The angels will be ordered], \"Gather those who committed wrong, their kinds,[1289] and what they used to worship\n\n**23** (23) Other than All?h, and guide them to the path of Hellfire\n\n**24** (24) And stop them; indeed, they are to be questioned.\"\n\n**25** (25) [They will be asked], \"What is [wrong] with you? Why do you not help each other?\"\n\n**26** (26) But they, that Day, are in surrender.\n\n**27** (27) And they will approach one another asking [i.e., blaming] each other.\n\n**28** (28) They will say, \"Indeed, you used to come at us from the right.\"[1290]\n\n**29** (29) They [i.e., the oppressors] will say, \"Rather, you [yourselves] were not believers,\n\n**3** (3) And those who recite the message,[1286]\n\n**30** (30) And we had over you no authority, but you were a transgressing people.\n\n**31** (31) So the word [i.e., decree] of our Lord has come into effect upon us; indeed, we will taste [punishment].\n\n**32** (32) And we led you to deviation; indeed, we were deviators.\"\n\n**33** (33) So indeed they, that Day, will be sharing in the punishment.\n\n**34** (34) Indeed, that is how We deal with the criminals.\n\n**35** (35) Indeed they, when it was said to them, \"There is no deity but All?h,\" were arrogant\n\n**36** (36) And were saying, \"Are we to leave our gods for a mad poet?\"\n\n**37** (37) Rather, he [i.e., the Prophet (?)] has come with the truth and confirmed the [previous] messengers.\n\n**38** (38) Indeed, you [disbelievers] will be tasters of the painful punishment,\n\n**39** (39) And you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do -\n\n**4** (4) Indeed, your God is One,\n\n**40** (40) But not the chosen servants of All?h.\n\n**41** (41) Those will have a provision determined -\n\n**42** (42) Fruits;[1291] and they will be honored\n\n**43** (43) In gardens of pleasure\n\n**44** (44) On thrones facing one another.\n\n**45** (45) There will be circulated among them a cup [of wine] from a flowing spring,\n\n**46** (46) White and delicious to the drinkers;\n\n**47** (47) No bad effect is there in it, nor from it will they be intoxicated.\n\n**48** (48) And with them will be women limiting [their] glances,[1292] with large, [beautiful] eyes,\n\n**49** (49) As if they were [delicate] eggs, well-protected.\n\n**5** (5) Lord of the heavens and the earth and that between them and Lord of the sunrises.[1287]\n\n**50** (50) And they will approach one another, inquiring of each other.\n\n**51** (51) A speaker among them will say, \"Indeed, I had a companion [on earth].\n\n**52** (52) Who would say, 'Are you indeed of those who believe\n\n**53** (53) That when we have died and become dust and bones, we will indeed be recompensed?'\"\n\n**54** (54) He will say,[1293] \"Would you [care to] look?\"\n\n**55** (55) And he will look and see him[1294] in the midst of the Hellfire.\n\n**56** (56) He will say, \"By All?h, you almost ruined me.\n\n**57** (57) If not for the favor of my Lord, I would have been of those brought in [to Hell].\n\n**58** (58) Then, are we not to die\n\n**59** (59) Except for our first death, and we will not be punished?\"\n\n**6** (6) Indeed, We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment of stars\n\n**60** (60) Indeed, this is the great attainment.\n\n**61** (61) For the like of this let the workers [on earth] work.\n\n**62** (62) Is that [i.e., Paradise] a better accommodation or the tree of zaqq?m?\n\n**63** (63) Indeed, We have made it a torment for the wrongdoers.\n\n**64** (64) Indeed, it is a tree issuing from the bottom of the Hellfire,\n\n**65** (65) Its emerging fruit as if it was heads of the devils.\n\n**66** (66) And indeed, they will eat from it and fill with it their bellies.\n\n**67** (67) Then indeed, they will have after it a mixture of scalding water.\n\n**68** (68) Then indeed, their return will be to the Hellfire.\n\n**69** (69) Indeed they found their fathers astray.\n\n**7** (7) And as protection against every rebellious devil\n\n**70** (70) So they hastened [to follow] in their footsteps.\n\n**71** (71) And there had already strayed before them most of the former peoples,\n\n**72** (72) And We had already sent among them warners.\n\n**73** (73) Then look how was the end of those who were warned -\n\n**74** (74) But not the chosen servants of All?h.\n\n**75** (75) And Noah had certainly called Us, and [We are] the best of responders.\n\n**76** (76) And We saved him and his family from the great affliction.\n\n**77** (77) And We made his descendants those remaining [on the earth]\n\n**78** (78) And left for him [favorable mention] among later generations:\n\n**79** (79) \"Peace upon Noah among the worlds.\"\n\n**8** (8) [So] they may not listen to the exalted assembly [of angels] and are pelted from every side,[1288]\n\n**80** (80) Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.\n\n**81** (81) Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.\n\n**82** (82) Then We drowned the others [i.e., disbelievers].\n\n**83** (83) And indeed, among his kind was Abraham,\n\n**84** (84) When he came to his Lord with a sound heart\n\n**85** (85) [And] when he said to his father and his people, \"What do you worship?\n\n**86** (86) Is it falsehood [as] gods other than All?h you desire?\n\n**87** (87) Then what is your thought about the Lord of the worlds?\"\n\n**88** (88) And he cast a look at the stars\n\n**89** (89) And said, \"Indeed, I am [about to be] ill.\"\n\n**9** (9) Repelled; and for them is a constant punishment,\n\n**90** (90) So they turned away from him, departing.\n\n**91** (91) Then he turned to their gods and said, \"Do you not eat?[1295]\n\n**92** (92) What is [wrong] with you that you do not speak?\"\n\n**93** (93) And he turned upon them a blow with [his] right hand.\n\n**94** (94) Then they [i.e., the people] came toward him, hastening.\n\n**95** (95) He said, \"Do you worship that which you [yourselves] carve,\n\n**96** (96) While All?h created you and that which you do?\"\n\n**97** (97) They said, \"Construct for him a structure [i.e., furnace] and throw him into the burning fire.\"\n\n**98** (98) And they intended for him a plan [i.e., harm], but We made them the most debased.\n\n**99** (99) And [then] he said, \"Indeed, I will go to [where I am ordered by] my Lord; He will guide me."

Then let them ascend through [any] ways of access.[1321]\n\n**11** (11) [They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers].\n\n**12** (12) The people of Noah denied before them, and [the tribe of] ?Aad and Pharaoh, the owner of stakes,[1322]\n\n**13** (13) And [the tribe of] Tham?d and the people of Lot and the companions of the thicket [i.e., people of Madyan]. Those are the companies.[1323]\n\n**14** (14) Each of them denied the messengers, so My penalty was justified.\n\n**15** (15) And these [disbelievers] await not but one blast [of the Horn]; for it there will be no delay.[1324]\n\n**16** (16) And they say, \"Our Lord, hasten for us our share [of the punishment] before the Day of Account.\"\n\n**17** (17) Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant, David, the possessor of strength; indeed, he was one who repeatedly turned back [to All?h].\n\n**18** (18) Indeed, We subjected the mountains [to praise] with him, exalting [All?h] in the [late] afternoon and [after] sunrise.\n\n**19** (19) And the birds were assembled, all with him repeating [praises].\n\n**2** (2) But those who disbelieve are in pride and dissension.\n\n**20** (20) And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and discernment in speech.\n\n**21** (21) And has there come to you the news of the adversaries, when they climbed over the wall of [his] prayer chamber -\n\n**22** (22) When they entered upon David and he was alarmed by them? They said, \"Fear not. [We are] two adversaries, one of whom has wronged the other, so judge between us with truth and do not exceed [it] and guide us to the sound path.\n\n**23** (23) Indeed this, my brother, has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe; so he said, 'Entrust her to me,' and he overpowered me in speech.\"\n\n**24** (24) [David] said, \"He has certainly wronged you in demanding your ewe [in addition] to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they.\" And David became certain that We had tried him, and he asked forgiveness of his Lord[1325] and fell down bowing [in prostration] and turned in repentance [to All?h].\n\n**25** (25) So We forgave him that; and indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.\n\n**26** (26) [We said], \"O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow [your own] desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of All?h.\" Indeed, those who go astray from the way of All?h will have a severe punishment for having forgotten the Day of Account.\n\n**27** (27) And We did not create the heaven and the earth and that between them aimlessly. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire.\n\n**28** (28) Or should We treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters in the land? Or should We treat those who fear All?h like the wicked?\n\n**29** (29) [This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.\n\n**3** (3) How many a generation have We destroyed before them, and they [then] called out; but it was not a time for escape.\n\n**30** (30) And to David We gave Solomon. An excellent servant, indeed he was one repeatedly turning back [to All?h].\n\n**31** (31) [Mention] when there were exhibited before him in the afternoon the poised [standing] racehorses.\n\n**32** (32) And he said, \"Indeed, I gave preference to the love of good [things] over the remembrance of my Lord until it [i.e., the sun] disappeared into the curtain [of darkness].\"\n\n**33** (33) [He said], \"Return them to me,\" and set about striking[1326] [their] legs and necks.\n\n**34** (34) And We certainly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a body;[1327] then he returned.[1328]\n\n**35** (35) He said, \"My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower.\"\n\n**36** (36) So We subjected to him the wind blowing by his command, gently, wherever he directed,\n\n**37** (37) And [also] the devils [of jinn] - every builder and diver\n\n**38** (38) And others bound together in irons.\n\n**39** (39) [We said], \"This is Our gift, so grant or withhold without account.\"\n\n**4** (4) And they wonder that there has come to them a warner [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)] from among themselves. And the disbelievers say, \"This is a magician and a liar.\n\n**40** (40) And indeed, for him is nearness to Us and a good place of return.\n\n**41** (41) And remember Our servant Job, when he called to his Lord, \"Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment.\"\n\n**42** (42) [So he was told], \"Strike [the ground] with your foot; this is a [spring for a] cool bath and drink.\"\n\n**43** (43) And We granted him his family and a like [number] with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding.\n\n**44** (44) [We said], \"And take in your hand a bunch [of grass] and strike with it and do not break your oath.\"[1329] Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was one repeatedly turning back [to All?h].\n\n**45** (45) And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision.\n\n**46** (46) Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [of the Hereafter].\n\n**47** (47) And indeed they are, to Us, among the chosen and outstanding.\n\n**48** (48) And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhul-Kifl, and all are among the outstanding.\n\n**49** (49) This is a reminder. And indeed, for the righteous is a good place of return -\n\n**5** (5) Has he made the gods [only] one God? Indeed, this is a curious thing.\"\n\n**50** (50) Gardens of perpetual residence, whose doors will be opened to them.\n\n**51** (51) Reclining within them, they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink.\n\n**52** (52) And with them will be women limiting [their] glances[1330] and of equal age.\n\n**53** (53) This is what you, [the righteous], are promised for the Day of Account.\n\n**54** (54) Indeed, this is Our provision; for it there is no depletion.\n\n**55** (55) This [is so]. But indeed, for the transgressors is an evil place of return -\n\n**56** (56) Hell, which they will [enter to] burn, and wretched is the resting place.\n\n**57** (57) This - so let them taste it - is scalding water and [foul] purulence.\n\n**58** (58) And other [punishments] of its type [in various] kinds.\n\n**59** (59) [Its inhabitants will say], \"This is a company bursting in with you. No welcome for them. Indeed, they will burn in the Fire.\"\n\n**6** (6) And the eminent among them went forth, [saying], \"Continue, and be patient over [the defense of] your gods. Indeed, this is a thing intended.[1318]\n\n**60** (60) They will say, \"Nor you! No welcome for you. You, [our leaders], brought this upon us, and wretched is the settlement.\"\n\n**61** (61) They will say, \"Our Lord, whoever brought this upon us - increase for him double punishment in the Fire.\"\n\n**62** (62) And they will say, \"Why do we not see men whom we used to count among the worst?[1331]\n\n**63** (63) Is it [because] we took them in ridicule, or has [our] vision turned away from them?\"\n\n**64** (64) Indeed, that is truth [i.e., reality] - the quarreling of the people of the Fire.\n\n**65** (65) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"I am only a warner, and there is not any deity except All?h, the One, the Prevailing,[1332]\n\n**66** (66) Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Exalted in Might,[1333] the Perpetual Forgiver.\"[1334]\n\n**67** (67) Say, \"It is great news\n\n**68** (68) From which you turn away.\n\n**69** (69) I had no knowledge of the exalted assembly [of angels] when they were disputing [the creation of Adam].\n\n**7** (7) We have not heard of this in the latest religion.[1319] This is not but a fabrication.\n\n**70** (70) It has not been revealed to me except that I am a clear warner.\"\n\n**71** (71) [So mention] when your Lord said to the angels, \"Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay.\n\n**72** (72) So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul,[1335] then fall down to him in prostration.\"\n\n**73** (73) So the angels prostrated - all of them entirely,\n\n**74** (74) Except Iblees;[1336] he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers.\n\n**75** (75) [All?h] said, \"O Iblees, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands?[1337] Were you arrogant [then], or were you [already] among the haughty?\"\n\n**76** (76) He said, \"I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.\"\n\n**77** (77) [All?h] said, \"Then get out of it [i.e., Paradise], for indeed, you are expelled.\n\n**78** (78) And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.\"\n\n**79** (79) He said, \"My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected.\"\n\n**8** (8) Has the message been revealed to him out of [all of] us?\" Rather, they are in doubt about My message. Rather, they have not yet tasted My punishment.\n\n**80** (80) [All?h] said, \"So indeed, you are of those reprieved\n\n**81** (81) Until the Day of the time well-known.\"\n\n**82** (82) [Iblees] said, \"By Your might, I will surely mislead them all\n\n**83** (83) Except, among them, Your chosen servants.\"\n\n**84** (84) [All?h] said, \"The truth [is My oath], and the truth I say -\n\n**85** (85) [That] I will surely fill Hell with you and those of them that follow you all together.\"\n\n**86** (86) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"I do not ask you for it [i.e., the Qur�?n] any payment, and I am not of the pretentious.\n\n**87** (87) It is but a reminder to the worlds.\n\n**88** (88) And you will surely know [the truth of] its information after a time.\"\n\n**9** (9) Or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower?[1320]"

For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of All?h is spacious. Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account [i.e., limit].\"\n\n**11** (11) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Indeed, I have been commanded to worship All?h, [being] sincere to Him in religion.\n\n**12** (12) And I have been commanded to be the first [among you] of the Muslims.\"\n\n**13** (13) Say, \"Indeed I fear, if I should disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.\"\n\n**14** (14) Say, \"All?h [alone] do I worship, sincere to Him in my religion,\n\n**15** (15) So worship what you will besides Him.\" Say, \"Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the manifest loss.\"\n\n**16** (16) They will have canopies [i.e., layers] of fire above them and below them, canopies. By that All?h threatens [i.e., warns] His servants. O My servants, then fear Me.\n\n**17** (17) But those who have avoided ??gh?t,[1346] lest they worship it, and turned back to All?h - for them are good tidings. So give good tidings to My servants\n\n**18** (18) Who listen to speech and follow the best of it. Those are the ones All?h has guided, and those are people of understanding.\n\n**19** (19) Then, is one who has deserved the decree of punishment [to be guided]? Then, can you save one who is in the Fire?\n\n**2** (2) Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book, [O Mu?ammad], in truth. So worship All?h, [being] sincere to Him in religion.\n\n**20** (20) But those who have feared their Lord - for them are chambers,[1347] above them chambers built high, beneath which rivers flow. [This is] the promise of All?h. All?h does not fail in [His] promise.\n\n**21** (21) Do you not see that All?h sends down rain from the sky and makes it flow as springs [and rivers] in the earth; then He produces thereby crops of varying colors; then they dry and you see them turned yellow; then He makes them [scattered] debris. Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding.\n\n**22** (22) So is one whose breast All?h has expanded to [accept] Isl?m and he is upon [i.e., guided by] a light from his Lord [like one whose heart rejects it]? Then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of All?h. Those are in manifest error.\n\n**23** (23) All?h has sent down the best statement: a consistent Book wherein is reiteration. The skins shiver therefrom of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts relax at the remembrance [i.e., mention] of All?h. That is the guidance of All?h by which He guides whom He wills. And one whom All?h sends astray - for him there is no guide.\n\n**24** (24) Then is he who will shield with his face[1348] the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection [like one secure from it]? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, \"Taste what you used to earn.\"\n\n**25** (25) Those before them denied, and punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive.\n\n**26** (26) So All?h made them taste disgrace in worldly life. But the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew.\n\n**27** (27) And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur�?n from every [kind of] example - that they might remember.\n\n**28** (28) [It is] an Arabic Qur�?n, without any deviance[1349] that they might become righteous.[1350]\n\n**29** (29) All?h presents an example: a man [i.e., slave] owned by quarreling partners and another belonging exclusively to one man - are they equal in comparison? Praise be to All?h! But most of them do not know.\n\n**3** (3) Unquestionably, for All?h is the pure religion.[1339] And those who take protectors besides Him [say], \"We only worship them that they may bring us nearer to All?h in position.\" Indeed, All?h will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, All?h does not guide he who is a liar and [confirmed] disbeliever.\n\n**30** (30) Indeed, you are to die, and indeed, they are to die.\n\n**31** (31) Then indeed you, on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord, will dispute.\n\n**32** (32) So who is more unjust than one who lies about All?h and denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell a residence for the disbelievers?\n\n**33** (33) And the one who has brought the truth [i.e., the Prophet (?)] and [they who] believed in it - those are the righteous.\n\n**34** (34) They will have whatever they desire with their Lord. That is the reward of the doers of good -\n\n**35** (35) That All?h may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them their due for the best of what they used to do.\n\n**36** (36) Is not All?h sufficient for His Servant [i.e., Prophet Mu?ammad (?)]? And [yet], they threaten you with those [they worship] other than Him. And whoever All?h leaves astray - for him there is no guide.\n\n**37** (37) And whoever All?h guides - for him there is no misleader. Is not All?h Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?\n\n**38** (38) And if you asked them, \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" they would surely say, \"All?h.\" Say, \"Then have you considered[1351] what you invoke besides All?h? If All?h intended me harm, are they removers of His harm; or if He intended me mercy, are they withholders of His mercy?\" Say, \"Sufficient for me is All?h; upon Him [alone] rely the [wise] reliers.\"\n\n**39** (39) Say, \"O my people, work according to your position, [for] indeed, I am working; and you are going to know\n\n**4** (4) If All?h had intended to take a son, He could have chosen from what He creates whatever He willed. Exalted is He; He is All?h, the One, the Prevailing.[1340]\n\n**40** (40) To whom will come a torment disgracing him and on whom will descend an enduring punishment.\"\n\n**41** (41) Indeed, We sent down to you the Book for the people in truth. So whoever is guided - it is for [the benefit of] his soul; and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment. And you are not a manager [i.e., authority] over them.\n\n**42** (42) All?h takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps those for which He has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.\n\n**43** (43) Or have they taken other than All?h as intercessors? Say, \"Even though they do not possess [power over] anything, nor do they reason?\"\n\n**44** (44) Say, \"To All?h belongs [the right to allow] intercession entirely. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned.\"\n\n**45** (45) And when All?h is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion, but when those [worshipped] other than Him are mentioned, immediately they rejoice.\n\n**46** (46) Say, \"O All?h, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You will judge between your servants concerning that over which they used to differ.\"\n\n**47** (47) And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth entirely and the like of it with it, they would [attempt to] ransom themselves thereby from the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear to them from All?h that which they had not taken into account.[1352]\n\n**48** (48) And there will appear to them the evils they had earned, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**49** (49) And when adversity touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We bestow on him a favor from Us, he says, \"I have only been given it because of [my] knowledge.\" Rather, it is a trial, but most of them do not know.\n\n**5** (5) He created the heavens and earth in truth. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. Unquestionably, He is the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.[1341]\n\n**50** (50) Those before them had already said it, but they were not availed by what they used to earn.\n\n**51** (51) And the evil consequences of what they earned struck them. And those who have wronged of these [people] will be struck [i.e., afflicted] by the evil consequences of what they earned; and they will not cause failure.[1353]\n\n**52** (52) Do they not know that All?h extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.\n\n**53** (53) Say, \"O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of All?h. Indeed, All?h forgives all sins.[1354] Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\n**54** (54) And return [in repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be helped.\n\n**55** (55) And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord [i.e., the Qur�?n] before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not perceive,\n\n**56** (56) Lest a soul should say,[1355] \"Oh, [how great is] my regret over what I neglected in regard to All?h and that I was among the mockers.\"\n\n**57** (57) Or [lest] it say, \"If only All?h had guided me, I would have been among the righteous.\"\n\n**58** (58) Or [lest] it say when it sees the punishment, \"If only I had another turn[1356] so I could be among the doers of good.\"\n\n**59** (59) But yes, there had come to you My verses, but you denied them and were arrogant, and you were among the disbelievers.\n\n**6** (6) He created you from one soul. Then He made from it its mate, and He produced for you from the grazing livestock eight mates.[1342] He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses.[1343] That is All?h, your Lord; to Him belongs dominion. There is no deity except Him, so how are you averted?\n\n**60** (60) And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about All?h [with] their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell a residence for the arrogant?\n\n**61** (61) And All?h will save those who feared Him by their attainment;[1357] no evil will touch them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**62** (62) All?h is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs.\n\n**63** (63) To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. And they who disbelieve in the verses of All?h - it is those who are the losers.\n\n**64** (64) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Is it other than All?h that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?\"\n\n**65** (65) And it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with All?h, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers.\n\n**66** (66) Rather, worship [only] All?h and be among the grateful.\n\n**67** (67) They have not appraised All?h with true appraisal,[1358] while the earth entirely will be [within] His grip[1359] on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand.[1360] Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.\n\n**68** (68) And the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will fall dead except whom All?h wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on.\n\n**69** (69) And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record [of deeds] will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**7** (7) If you disbelieve - indeed, All?h is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves [i.e., likes] it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**70** (70) And every soul will be fully compensated [for] what it did; and He is most knowing[1361] of what they do.\n\n**71** (71) And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, its gates are opened and its keepers will say, \"Did there not come to you messengers from yourselves, reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?\" They will say, \"Yes, but the word [i.e., decree] of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers.\"\n\n**72** (72) [To them] it will be said, \"Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant.\"\n\n**73** (73) But those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it while its gates have been opened and its keepers say, \"Peace be upon you; you have become pure; so enter it to abide eternally therein,\" [they will enter].[1362]\n\n**74** (74) And they will say, \"Praise to All?h, who has fulfilled for us His promise and made us inherit the earth [so] we may settle in Paradise wherever we will. And excellent is the reward of [righteous] workers.\"\n\n**75** (75) And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting [All?h] with praise of their Lord. And it will be judged between them in truth, and it will be said, \"[All] praise to All?h, Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**8** (8) And when adversity touches man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him [alone]; then when He bestows on him a favor from Himself, he forgets Him whom he called upon before,[1344] and he attributes to All?h equals to mislead [people] from His way. Say, \"Enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of the companions of the Fire.\"\n\n**9** (9) Is one who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, [like one who does not]? Say, \"Are those who know equal to those who do not know?\" Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding."

So is there to an exit any way?\"\n\n**12** (12) [They will be told], \"That is because, when All?h was called upon alone, you disbelieved; but if others were associated with Him, you believed. So the judgement is with All?h, the Most High, the Grand.\"\n\n**13** (13) It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you from the sky, provision. But none will remember except he who turns back [in repentance].\n\n**14** (14) So invoke All?h, [being] sincere to Him in religion, although the disbelievers dislike it.\n\n**15** (15) [He is] the Exalted above [all] degrees, Owner of the Throne; He places the inspiration of His command [i.e., revelation] upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting.\n\n**16** (16) The Day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from All?h. To whom belongs [all] sovereignty this Day? To All?h, the One, the Prevailing.[1365]\n\n**17** (17) This Day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today! Indeed, All?h is swift in account.\n\n**18** (18) And warn them, [O Mu?ammad], of the Approaching Day, when hearts are at the throats, filled [with distress]. For the wrongdoers there will be no devoted friend and no intercessor [who is] obeyed.\n\n**19** (19) He knows that which deceives the eyes and what the breasts conceal.\n\n**2** (2) The revelation of the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] is from All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Knowing,\n\n**20** (20) And All?h judges with truth, while those they invoke[1366] besides Him judge not with anything. Indeed, All?h - He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\n\n**21** (21) Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those who were before them? They were greater than them in strength and in impression on the land, but All?h seized them for their sins. And they had not from All?h any protector.\n\n**22** (22) That was because their messengers were coming to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so All?h seized them. Indeed, He is Powerful and severe in punishment.\n\n**23** (23) And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs and a clear authority[1367]\n\n**24** (24) To Pharaoh, H?m?n and Q?r?n, but they said, \"[He is] a magician and a liar.\"\n\n**25** (25) And when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, \"Kill the sons of those who have believed with him and keep their women alive.\" But the plan of the disbelievers is not except in error.\n\n**26** (26) And Pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption[1368] in the land.\"\n\n**27** (27) But Moses said, \"Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account.\"\n\n**28** (28) And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, \"Do you kill a man [merely] because he says, 'My Lord is All?h' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he should be lying, then upon him is [the consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promises you. Indeed, All?h does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar.\n\n**29** (29) O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of All?h if it came to us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct.\"\n\n**3** (3) The forgiver of sin, acceptor of repentance, severe in punishment, owner of abundance. There is no deity except Him; to Him is the destination.\n\n**30** (30) And he who believed said, \"O my people, indeed I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the companies[1369] -\n\n**31** (31) Like the custom of the people of Noah and of ?Aad and Tham?d and those after them. And All?h wants no injustice for [His] servants.\n\n**32** (32) And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling[1370] -\n\n**33** (33) The Day you will turn your backs fleeing; there is not for you from All?h any protector. And whoever All?h sends astray - there is not for him any guide.\n\n**34** (34) And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will All?h send a messenger after him.' Thus does All?h leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic.\"\n\n**35** (35) Those who dispute concerning the signs of All?h without an authority[1371] having come to them - great is hatred [of them] in the sight of All?h and in the sight of those who have believed. Thus does All?h seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant.\n\n**36** (36) And Pharaoh said, \"O H?m?n, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways[1372] -\n\n**37** (37) The ways into the heavens - so that I may look at the deity of Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar.\" And thus was made attractive to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way. And the plan of Pharaoh was not except in ruin.\n\n**38** (38) And he who believed said, \"O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the way of right conduct.\n\n**39** (39) O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed, the Hereafter - that is the home of [permanent] settlement.\n\n**4** (4) No one disputes concerning the signs of All?h except those who disbelieve, so be not deceived by their [uninhibited] movement throughout the land.\n\n**40** (40) Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise, being given provision therein without account.\n\n**41** (41) And O my people, how is it that I invite you to salvation while you invite me to the Fire?\n\n**42** (42) You invite me to disbelieve in All?h and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.[1373]\n\n**43** (43) Assuredly, that to which you invite me has no [response to a] supplication in this world or in the Hereafter; and indeed, our return is to All?h, and indeed, the transgressors will be companions of the Fire.\n\n**44** (44) And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to All?h. Indeed, All?h is Seeing of [His] servants.\"\n\n**45** (45) So All?h protected him from the evils they plotted, and the people of Pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment -\n\n**46** (46) The Fire; they are exposed to it morning and evening.[1374] And the Day the Hour appears [it will be said], \"Make the people of Pharaoh enter the severest punishment.\"\n\n**47** (47) And [mention] when they will argue within the Fire, and the weak will say to those who had been arrogant, \"Indeed, we were [only] your followers, so will you relieve us of a share of the Fire?\"\n\n**48** (48) Those who had been arrogant will say, \"Indeed, all [of us] are in it. Indeed, All?h has judged between the servants.\"\n\n**49** (49) And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, \"Supplicate your Lord to lighten for us a day from the punishment.\"\n\n**5** (5) The people of Noah denied before them and the [disbelieving] factions after them, and every nation intended [a plot] for their messenger to seize him, and they disputed by [using] falsehood to [attempt to] invalidate thereby the truth. So I seized them, and how [terrible] was My penalty.\n\n**50** (50) They will say, \"Did there not come to you your messengers with clear proofs?\" They will say, \"Yes.\" They will reply, \"Then supplicate [yourselves], but the supplication of the disbelievers is not except in error [i.e., futility].\"\n\n**51** (51) Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand -\n\n**52** (52) The Day their excuse will not benefit the wrongdoers, and they will have the curse, and they will have the worst home [i.e., Hell].\n\n**53** (53) And We had certainly given Moses guidance, and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture\n\n**54** (54) As guidance and a reminder for those of understanding.\n\n**55** (55) So be patient, [O Mu?ammad]. Indeed, the promise of All?h is truth. And ask forgiveness for your sin[1375] and exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning.\n\n**56** (56) Indeed, those who dispute concerning the signs of All?h without [any] evidence having come to them - there is not within their breasts except pride, [the extent of] which they cannot reach. So seek refuge in All?h. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Seeing.\n\n**57** (57) The creation of the heavens and earth is greater than the creation of mankind, but most of the people do not know.\n\n**58** (58) And not equal are the blind and the seeing, nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer. Little do you remember.\n\n**59** (59) Indeed, the Hour is coming - no doubt about it - but most of the people do not believe.\n\n**6** (6) And thus has the word [i.e., decree] of your Lord come into effect upon those who disbelieved that they are companions of the Fire.\n\n**60** (60) And your Lord says, \"Call upon Me; I will respond to you.\" Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible.\n\n**61** (61) It is All?h who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day giving sight.[1376] Indeed, All?h is the possessor of bounty for the people, but most of them are not grateful.\n\n**62** (62) That is All?h, your Lord, Creator of all things; there is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?\n\n**63** (63) Thus were those [before you] deluded who were rejecting the signs of All?h.\n\n**64** (64) It is All?h who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a structure [i.e., ceiling] and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things. That is All?h, your Lord; then blessed is All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**65** (65) He is the Ever-Living;[1377] there is no deity except Him, so call upon Him, [being] sincere to Him in religion. [All] praise is [due] to All?h, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**66** (66) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besides All?h once the clear proofs have come to me from my Lord, and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**67** (67) It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot; then He brings you out as a child; then [He develops you] that you reach your [time of] maturity, then [further] that you become elders. And among you is he who is taken in death before [that], so that you reach a specified term;[1378] and perhaps you will use reason.\n\n**68** (68) He it is who gives life and causes death; and when He decrees a matter, He but says to it, \"Be,\" and it is.\n\n**69** (69) Do you not consider those who dispute concerning the signs of All?h - how are they averted?\n\n**7** (7) Those [angels] who carry the Throne and those around it exalt [All?h] with praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed, [saying], \"Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who have repented and followed Your way and protect them from the punishment of Hellfire.\n\n**70** (70) Those who deny the Book [i.e., the Qur�?n] and that with which We sent Our messengers - they are going to know,\n\n**71** (71) When the shackles are around their necks and the chains; they will be dragged\n\n**72** (72) In boiling water; then in the Fire they will be filled [with flame].\n\n**73** (73) Then it will be said to them, \"Where is that which you used to associate [with Him in worship]\n\n**74** (74) Other than All?h?\" They will say, \"They have departed from us; rather, we did not used to invoke previously anything.\" Thus does All?h put astray the disbelievers.\n\n**75** (75) [The angels will say], \"That was because you used to exult upon the earth without right and you used to behave insolently.\n\n**76** (76) Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant.\"\n\n**77** (77) So be patient, [O Mu?ammad]; indeed, the promise of All?h is truth. And whether We show you some of what We have promised them or We take you in death, it is to Us they will be returned.\n\n**78** (78) And We have already sent messengers before you. Among them are those [whose stories] We have related to you, and among them are those [whose stories] We have not related to you. And it was not for any messenger to bring a sign [or verse] except by permission of All?h. So when the command of All?h comes, it will be concluded [i.e., judged] in truth, and the falsifiers will thereupon lose [all].\n\n**79** (79) It is All?h who made for you the grazing animals upon which you ride, and some of them you eat.\n\n**8** (8) Our Lord, and admit them to gardens of perpetual residence which You have promised them and whoever was righteous among their forefathers, their spouses and their offspring. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**80** (80) And for you therein are [other] benefits and that you may realize upon them a need which is in your breasts;[1379] and upon them and upon ships you are carried.\n\n**81** (81) And He shows you His signs. So which of the signs of All?h do you deny?\n\n**82** (82) Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than themselves and greater in strength and in impression on the land, but they were not availed by what they used to earn.\n\n**83** (83) And when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they [merely] rejoiced in what they had of knowledge, but they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**84** (84) And when they saw Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in All?h alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him.\"\n\n**85** (85) But never did their faith benefit them once they saw Our punishment. [It is] the established way of All?h which has preceded among His servants. And the disbelievers thereupon lost [all].\n\n**9** (9) And protect them from the evil consequences [of their deeds]. And he whom You protect from evil consequences that Day - You will have given him mercy. And that is the great attainment.\""

And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps [i.e., stars, for beauty] and as protection.[1387] That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.\n\n**13** (13) But if they turn away, then say, \"I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt [that struck] ?Aad and Tham?d.\n\n**14** (14) [That occurred] when the messengers had come to them before them and after them, [saying], \"Worship not except All?h.\" They said, \"If our Lord had willed,[1388] He would have sent down the angels, so indeed we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers.\"\n\n**15** (15) As for ?Aad, they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said, \"Who is greater than us in strength?\" Did they not consider that All?h who created them was greater than them in strength? But they were rejecting Our signs.\n\n**16** (16) So We sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgracing, and they will not be helped.\n\n**17** (17) And as for Tham?d, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them for what they used to earn.\n\n**18** (18) And We saved those who believed and used to fear All?h.\n\n**19** (19) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], the Day when the enemies of All?h will be gathered to the Fire while they are [driven], assembled in rows,\n\n**2** (2) [This is] a revelation from the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful -\n\n**20** (20) Until, when they reach it, their hearing and their eyes and their skins will testify against them of what they used to do.\n\n**21** (21) And they will say to their skins, \"Why have you testified against us?\" They will say, \"We were made to speak by All?h, who has made everything speak; and He created you the first time, and to Him you are returned.\n\n**22** (22) And you were not covering [i.e., protecting] yourselves,[1389] lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins, but you assumed that All?h does not know much of what you do.\n\n**23** (23) And that was your assumption which you assumed about your Lord. It has brought you to ruin, and you have become among the losers.\"\n\n**24** (24) So [even] if they are patient, the Fire is a residence for them; and if they ask to appease [All?h], they will not be of those who are allowed to appease.\n\n**25** (25) And We appointed for them companions[1390] who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them [of sin], and the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect upon them among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.\n\n**26** (26) And those who disbelieve say, \"Do not listen to this Qur�?n and speak noisily[1391] during [the recitation of] it that perhaps you will overcome.\"\n\n**27** (27) But We will surely cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they had been doing.\n\n**28** (28) That is the recompense of the enemies of All?h - the Fire. For them therein is the home of eternity as recompense for what they, of Our verses, were rejecting.\n\n**29** (29) And those who disbelieved will [then] say, \"Our Lord, show us those who misled us of the jinn and men [so] we may put them under our feet[1392] that they will be among the lowest.\"\n\n**3** (3) A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Qur�?n[1382] for a people who know,\n\n**30** (30) Indeed, those who have said, \"Our Lord is All?h\" and then remained on a right course - the angels will descend upon them, [saying], \"Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.\n\n**31** (31) We [angels] were your allies in worldly life and [are so] in the Hereafter. And you will have therein whatever your souls desire, and you will have therein whatever you request [or wish]\n\n**32** (32) As accommodation from a [Lord who is] Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**33** (33) And who is better in speech than one who invites to All?h and does righteousness and says, \"Indeed, I am of the Muslims.\"\n\n**34** (34) And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon, the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend.\n\n**35** (35) But none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having a great portion [of good].\n\n**36** (36) And if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then seek refuge in All?h. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.\n\n**37** (37) And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to All?h, who created them, if it should be Him that you worship.[1393]\n\n**38** (38) But if they are arrogant - then those who are near your Lord [i.e., the angels] exalt Him by night and by day, and they do not become weary.\n\n**39** (39) And of His signs is that you see the earth stilled, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and grows. Indeed, He who has given it life is the Giver of Life to the dead. Indeed, He is over all things competent.\n\n**4** (4) As a giver of good tidings and a warner; but most of them turn away, so they do not hear.\n\n**40** (40) Indeed, those who inject deviation into Our verses[1394] are not concealed from Us. So, is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you will; indeed, He is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**41** (41) Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message [i.e., the Qur�?n][1395] after it has come to them...[1396] And indeed, it is a mighty[1397] Book.\n\n**42** (42) Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it; [it is] a revelation from a [Lord who is] Wise and Praiseworthy.\n\n**43** (43) Nothing is said to you, [O Mu?ammad], except what was already said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is a possessor of forgiveness and a possessor of painful penalty.\n\n**44** (44) And if We had made it a foreign [i.e., non-Arabic] Qur�?n, they would have said, \"Why are its verses not explained in detail [in our language]? Is it a foreign [recitation] and an Arab [messenger]?\" Say, \"It is, for those who believe, a guidance and cure.\" And those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is upon them blindness. Those are being called from a distant place.[1398]\n\n**45** (45) And We had already given Moses the Scripture, but it came under disagreement.[1399] And if not for a word [i.e., decree][1400] that preceded from your Lord, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed they are, concerning it [i.e., the Qur�?n], in disquieting doubt.\n\n**46** (46) Whoever does righteousness - it is for his [own] soul; and whoever does evil [does so] against it. And your Lord is not ever unjust to [His] servants.\n\n**47** (47) To Him [alone] is attributed knowledge of the Hour. And fruits emerge not from their coverings nor does a female conceive or give birth except with His knowledge. And the Day He will call to them, \"Where are My 'partners'?\" they will say, \"We announce to You that there is [no longer] among us any witness [to that].\"\n\n**48** (48) And lost from them will be those they were invoking before, and they will be certain that they have no place of escape.\n\n**49** (49) Man is not weary of supplication for good [things], but if evil touches him, he is hopeless and despairing.\n\n**5** (5) And they say, \"Our hearts are within coverings [i.e., screened] from that to which you invite us, and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a partition, so work;[1383] indeed, we are working.\"\n\n**50** (50) And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity which has touched him, he will surely say, \"This is [due] to me,[1401] and I do not think the Hour will occur; and [even] if I should be returned to my Lord, indeed, for me there will be with Him the best.\" But We will surely inform those who disbelieved about what they did, and We will surely make them taste a massive punishment.\n\n**51** (51) And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, then he is full of extensive supplication.\n\n**52** (52) Say, \"Have you considered: if it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is from All?h and you disbelieved in it, who would be more astray than one who is in extreme dissension?\"\n\n**53** (53) We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth.[1402] But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?[1403]\n\n**54** (54) Unquestionably, they are in doubt about the meeting with their Lord. Unquestionably He is, of all things, encompassing.\n\n**6** (6) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness.\" And woe to those who associate others with All?h �\n\n**7** (7) Those who do not give zak?h, and in the Hereafter they are disbelievers.\n\n**8** (8) Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them is a reward uninterrupted.\n\n**9** (9) Say, \"Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him equals? That is the Lord of the worlds.\""

    "content": "**1** (1) ??, Meem.\n\n**10** (10) And in anything over which you disagree - its ruling is [to be referred] to All?h. [Say], \"That is All?h, my Lord; upon Him I have relied, and to Him I turn back.\"[1410]\n\n**11** (11) [He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you from yourselves, mates, and among the cattle, mates; He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing like unto Him,[1411] and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.[1412]\n\n**12** (12) To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed He is, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**13** (13) He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - to establish the religion and not be divided therein. Difficult for those who associate others with All?h is that to which you invite them. All?h chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him].\n\n**14** (14) And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And if not for a word[1413] that preceded from your Lord [postponing the penalty] until a specified time, it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, those who were granted inheritance of the Scripture after them are, concerning it, in disquieting doubt.\n\n**15** (15) So to that [religion of All?h] invite, [O Mu?ammad],[1414] and remain on a right course as you are commanded and do not follow their inclinations but say, \"I have believed in what All?h has revealed of scripture [i.e., the Qur�?n], and I have been commanded to do justice among you. All?h is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our deeds, and for you your deeds.[1415] There is no [need for] argument between us and you.[1416] All?h will bring us together, and to Him is the [final] destination.\"\n\n**16** (16) And those who argue concerning All?h after He has been responded to[1417] - their argument is invalid with their Lord, and upon them is [His] wrath, and for them is a severe punishment.\n\n**17** (17) It is All?h who has sent down the Book in truth and [also] the balance [i.e., justice]. And what will make you perceive? Perhaps the Hour is near.\n\n**18** (18) Those who do not believe in it are impatient for it,[1418] but those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth. Unquestionably, those who dispute concerning the Hour are in extreme error.\n\n**19** (19) All?h is Subtle[1419] with His servants; He gives provision to whom He wills. And He is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might.\n\n**2** (2) ?Ayn, Seen, Q?f.[1405]\n\n**20** (20) Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him in his harvest [i.e., reward]. And whoever desires the harvest [i.e., benefits] of this world - We give him thereof, but there is not for him in the Hereafter any share.\n\n**21** (21) Or have they partners [i.e., other deities] who have ordained for them a religion to which All?h has not consented? But if not for the decisive word,[1420] it would have been concluded between them. And indeed, the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment.\n\n**22** (22) You will see the wrongdoers fearful of what they have earned, and it will [certainly] befall them. And those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in lush regions of the gardens [in Paradise] having whatever they will in the presence of their Lord. That is what is the great bounty.\n\n**23** (23) It is that of which All?h gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"I do not ask you for it [i.e., this message] any payment [but] only good will through [i.e., due to] kinship.\" And whoever commits a good deed - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Appreciative.[1421]\n\n**24** (24) Or do they say, \"He has invented about All?h a lie\"? But if All?h willed, He could seal over your heart.[1422] And All?h eliminates falsehood and establishes the truth by His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**25** (25) And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds, and He knows what you do.\n\n**26** (26) And He answers [the supplication of] those who have believed and done righteous deeds and increases [for] them from His bounty. But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment.\n\n**27** (27) And if All?h had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Aware and Seeing.\n\n**28** (28) And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**29** (29) And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures. And He, for gathering them when He wills, is competent.\n\n**3** (3) Thus has He revealed to you, [O Mu?ammad], and to those before you - All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**30** (30) And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned; but He pardons much.\n\n**31** (31) And you will not cause failure [to All?h][1423] upon the earth. And you have not besides All?h any protector or helper.\n\n**32** (32) And of His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains.\n\n**33** (33) If He willed, He could still the wind, and they would remain motionless on its surface. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful.\n\n**34** (34) Or He could destroy them[1424] for what they earned; but He pardons much.\n\n**35** (35) And [that is so] those who dispute concerning Our signs may know that for them there is no place of escape.\n\n**36** (36) So whatever thing you have been given - it is but [for] enjoyment of the worldly life. But what is with All?h is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their Lord rely\n\n**37** (37) And those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, and when they are angry, they forgive,\n\n**38** (38) And those who have responded to their Lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves, and from what We have provided them, they spend,\n\n**39** (39) And those who, when tyranny strikes them, they retaliate [in a just manner].[1425]\n\n**4** (4) To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.[1406]\n\n**40** (40) And the retribution for an evil act is an evil one like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation - his reward is [due] from All?h. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers.\n\n**41** (41) And whoever retaliates after having been wronged - those have not upon them any cause [for blame].\n\n**42** (42) The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment.\n\n**43** (43) And whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of resolve.[1426]\n\n**44** (44) And he whom All?h sends astray - for him there is no protector beyond Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, \"Is there for return [to the former world] any way?\"\n\n**45** (45) And you will see them being exposed to it [i.e., the Fire], humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert glance. And those who had believed will say, \"Indeed, the [true] losers are the ones who lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, the wrongdoers are in an enduring punishment.\"\n\n**46** (46) And there will not be for them any allies to aid them other than All?h. And whoever All?h sends astray - for him there is no way.\n\n**47** (47) Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from All?h of which there is no repelling. No refuge will you have that Day, nor for you will there be any denial.[1427]\n\n**48** (48) But if they turn away - then We have not sent you, [O Mu?ammad], over them as a guardian; upon you is only [the duty of] notification. And indeed, when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but if evil afflicts him for what his hands have put forth, then indeed, man is ungrateful.\n\n**49** (49) To All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He wills. He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males.\n\n**5** (5) The heavens almost break from above them,[1407] and the angels exalt [All?h] with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth. Unquestionably, it is All?h who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\n\n**50** (50) Or He makes them [both] males and females, and He renders whom He wills barren. Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent.\n\n**51** (51) And it is not for any human being that All?h should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a partition or that He sends a messenger [i.e., angel] to reveal, by His permission, what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.\n\n**52** (52) And thus We have revealed to you an inspiration of Our command [i.e., the Qur�?n]. You did not know what is the Book or [what is] faith, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, [O Mu?ammad], you guide to a straight path -\n\n**53** (53) The path of All?h, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Unquestionably, to All?h do [all] matters evolve [i.e., return].\n\n**6** (6) And those who take as allies other than Him - All?h is [yet] Guardian over them; and you, [O Mu?ammad], are not over them a manager -\n\n**7** (7) And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur�?n that you may warn the Mother of Cities [i.e., Makkah] and those around it[1408] and warn of the Day of Assembly, about which there is no doubt. A party will be in Paradise and a party in the Blaze.\n\n**8** (8) And if All?h willed, He could have made them [of] one religion, but He admits whom He wills[1409] into His mercy. And the wrongdoers have not any protector or helper.\n\n**9** (9) Or have they taken protectors [or allies] besides Him? But All?h - He is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead, and He is over all things competent."

Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned.\n\n**2** (2) By the clear Book,\n\n**20** (20) And they said, \"If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them.\" They have of that no knowledge. They are not but misjudging.\n\n**21** (21) Or have We given them a book before it [i.e., the Qur�?n] to which they are adhering?\n\n**22** (22) Rather, they say, \"Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are in their footsteps [rightly] guided.\"\n\n**23** (23) And similarly, We did not send before you any warner into a city except that its affluent said, \"Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion, and we are, in their footsteps, following.\"\n\n**24** (24) [Each warner] said, \"Even if I brought you better guidance than that [religion] upon which you found your fathers?\" They said, \"Indeed we, in that with which you were sent, are disbelievers.\"\n\n**25** (25) So We took retribution from them; then see how was the end of the deniers.\n\n**26** (26) And [mention, O Mu?ammad], when Abraham said to his father and his people, \"Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship\n\n**27** (27) Except for He who created me; and indeed, He will guide me.\"\n\n**28** (28) And he made it[1436] a word remaining among his descendants that they might return [to it].\n\n**29** (29) However, I gave enjoyment to these [people of Makkah] and their fathers[1437] until there came to them the truth and a clear Messenger.[1438]\n\n**3** (3) Indeed, We have made it an Arabic Qur�?n that you might understand.\n\n**30** (30) But when the truth came to them, they said, \"This is magic, and indeed we are, concerning it, disbelievers.\"\n\n**31** (31) And they said, \"Why was this Qur�?n not sent down upon a great man from [one of] the two cities?\"[1439]\n\n**32** (32) Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] that they may make use of one another for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than whatever they accumulate.\n\n**33** (33) And if it were not that the people would become one community [of disbelievers],[1440] We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful - for their houses - ceilings and stairways of silver upon which to mount.\n\n**34** (34) And for their houses - doors and couches [of silver] upon which to recline\n\n**35** (35) And gold ornament. But all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life. And the Hereafter with your Lord is for the righteous.\n\n**36** (36) And whoever is blinded from remembrance of the Most Merciful - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion.\n\n**37** (37) And indeed, they [i.e., the devils] avert them from the way [of guidance] while they think that they are [rightly] guided\n\n**38** (38) Until, when he comes to Us [at Judgement], he says [to his companion], \"How I wish there was between me and you the distance between the east and west; and what a wretched companion.\"\n\n**39** (39) And never will it benefit you that Day, when you have wronged, that you are [all] sharing in the punishment.\n\n**4** (4) And indeed it is, in the Mother of the Book[1430] with Us, exalted and full of wisdom.[1431]\n\n**40** (40) Then will you make the deaf hear, [O Mu?ammad], or guide the blind or he who is in clear error?\n\n**41** (41) And whether [or not] We take you away [in death], indeed, We will take retribution upon them.\n\n**42** (42) Or whether [or not] We show you that which We have promised them, indeed, We are Perfect in Ability.\n\n**43** (43) So adhere to that which is revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path.\n\n**44** (44) And indeed, it is a remembrance[1441] for you and your people, and you [all] are going to be questioned.\n\n**45** (45) And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers; have We made besides the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?\n\n**46** (46) And certainly did We send Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his establishment, and he said, \"Indeed, I am the messenger of the Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**47** (47) But when he brought them Our signs, at once they laughed at them.\n\n**48** (48) And We showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister, and We seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return [to faith].\n\n**49** (49) And they said [to Moses], \"O magician, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. Indeed, we will be guided.\"\n\n**5** (5) Then should We turn the message away, disregarding you, because you are a transgressing people?\n\n**50** (50) But when We removed from them the affliction, at once they broke their word.\n\n**51** (51) And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, \"O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me; then do you not see?\n\n**52** (52) Or am I [not] better than this one [i.e., Moses] who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear?[1442]\n\n**53** (53) Then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction?\"\n\n**54** (54) So he bluffed his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were [themselves] a people defiantly disobedient [of All?h].\n\n**55** (55) And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all.\n\n**56** (56) And We made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples.\n\n**57** (57) And when the son of Mary was presented as an example,[1443] immediately your people laughed aloud.\n\n**58** (58) And they said, \"Are our gods better, or is he?\"[1444] They did not present it [i.e., the comparison] except for [mere] argument. But, [in fact], they are a people prone to dispute.\n\n**59** (59) He [i.e., Jesus] was not but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.\n\n**6** (6) And how many a prophet We sent among the former peoples,\n\n**60** (60) And if We willed, We could have made [instead] of you angels succeeding [one another][1445] on the earth.\n\n**61** (61) And indeed, he [i.e., Jesus] will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me.[1446] This is a straight path.\n\n**62** (62) And never let Satan avert you. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.\n\n**63** (63) And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, \"I have come to you with wisdom [i.e., prophethood] and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear All?h and obey me.\n\n**64** (64) Indeed, All?h is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.\"\n\n**65** (65) But the denominations from among them differed [and separated], so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful Day.\n\n**66** (66) Are they waiting except for the Hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not?\n\n**67** (67) Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous\n\n**68** (68) [To whom All?h will say], \"O My servants, no fear will there be concerning you this Day, nor will you grieve,\n\n**69** (69) [You] who believed in Our verses and were Muslims.\n\n**7** (7) But there would not come to them a prophet except that they used to ridicule him.\n\n**70** (70) Enter Paradise, you and your kinds,[1447] delighted.\"\n\n**71** (71) Circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold. And therein is whatever the souls desire and [what] delights the eyes, and you will abide therein eternally.\n\n**72** (72) And that is Paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do.\n\n**73** (73) For you therein is much fruit[1448] from which you will eat.\n\n**74** (74) Indeed, the criminals will be in the punishment of Hell, abiding eternally.\n\n**75** (75) It will not be allowed to subside for them, and they, therein, are in despair.\n\n**76** (76) And We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers.\n\n**77** (77) And they will call, \"O M?lik,[1449] let your Lord put an end to us!\" He will say, \"Indeed, you will remain.\"\n\n**78** (78) We had certainly brought you the truth, but most of you, to the truth, were averse.\n\n**79** (79) Or have they devised [some] affair?[1450] But indeed, We are devising [a plan].\n\n**8** (8) And We destroyed greater than them[1432] in [striking] power, and the example of the former peoples has preceded.\n\n**80** (80) Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private conversations? Yes, [We do], and Our messengers [i.e., angels] are with them recording.\n\n**81** (81) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"If the Most Merciful had a son, then I would be the first of [his] worshippers.\"[1451]\n\n**82** (82) Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe.\n\n**83** (83) So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised.\n\n**84** (84) And it is He [i.e., All?h] who is [the only] deity in the heaven, and on the earth [the only] deity. And He is the Wise, the Knowing.\n\n**85** (85) And blessed is He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with whom is knowledge of the Hour and to whom you will be returned.\n\n**86** (86) And those they invoke[1452] besides Him do not possess [power of] intercession; but only those who testify to the truth [can benefit], and they know.[1453]\n\n**87** (87) And if you asked them[1454] who created them, they would surely say, \"All?h.\" So how are they deluded?\n\n**88** (88) And [All?h acknowledges] his saying,[1455] \"O my Lord, indeed these are a people who do not believe.\"\n\n**89** (89) So turn aside from them and say, \"Peace.\"[1456] But they are going to know.\n\n**9** (9) And if you should ask them, \"Who has created the heavens and the earth?\" they would surely say, \"They were created by the Exalted in Might, the Knowing,\""

And those who have disbelieved in the verses of their Lord will have a painful punishment of foul nature.\n\n**12** (12) It is All?h who subjected to you the sea so that ships may sail upon it by His command and that you may seek of His bounty; and perhaps you will be grateful.\n\n**13** (13) And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.\n\n**14** (14) Say, [O Mu?ammad], to those who have believed that they [should] forgive those who expect not the days of All?h [i.e., of His retribution] so that He may recompense a people[1470] for what they used to earn.\n\n**15** (15) Whoever does a good deed - it is for himself; and whoever does evil - it is against it [i.e., the self or soul]. Then to your Lord you will be returned.\n\n**16** (16) And We did certainly give the Children of Israel the Scripture and judgement[1471] and prophethood, and We provided them with good things and preferred them over the worlds.\n\n**17** (17) And We gave them clear proofs of the matter [of religion]. And they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.\n\n**18** (18) Then We put you, [O Mu?ammad], on an ordained way concerning the matter [of religion]; so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know.\n\n**19** (19) Indeed, they will never avail you against All?h at all. And indeed, the wrongdoers are allies of one another; but All?h is the protector of the righteous.\n\n**2** (2) The revelation of the Book is from All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**20** (20) This [Qur�?n] is enlightenment for mankind and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain [in faith].\n\n**21** (21) Or do those who commit evils think We will make them like those who have believed and done righteous deeds - [make them] equal in their life and their death?[1472] Evil is that which they judge [i.e., assume].\n\n**22** (22) And All?h created the heavens and earth in truth and so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**23** (23) Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire, and All?h has sent him astray due to knowledge[1473] and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? So who will guide him after All?h? Then will you not be reminded?\n\n**24** (24) And they say, \"There is not but our worldly life; we die and live,[1474] and nothing destroys us except time.\" And they have of that no knowledge; they are only assuming.\n\n**25** (25) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, their argument is only that they say, \"Bring [back] our forefathers, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**26** (26) Say, \"All?h causes you to live, then causes you to die; then He will assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt, but most of the people do not know.\"\n\n**27** (27) And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And the Day the Hour appears - that Day the falsifiers will lose.\n\n**28** (28) And you will see every nation kneeling [from fear]. Every nation will be called to its record [and told], \"Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do.\n\n**29** (29) This, Our record, speaks about you in truth. Indeed, We were having transcribed[1475] whatever you used to do.\"\n\n**3** (3) Indeed, within the heavens and earth are signs for the believers.\n\n**30** (30) So as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them into His mercy.

We assume only assumption, and we are not convinced.'\"\n\n**33** (33) And the evil consequences of what they did will appear to them, and they will be enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**34** (34) And it will be said, \"Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours, and your refuge is the Fire, and for you there are no helpers.\n\n**35** (35) That is because you took the verses of All?h in ridicule, and worldly life deluded you.\" So that Day they will not be removed from it, nor will they be asked to appease [All?h].\n\n**36** (36) Then, to All?h belongs [all] praise - Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds.\n\n**37** (37) And to Him belongs [all] grandeur within the heavens and the earth, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**4** (4) And in the creation of yourselves and what He disperses of moving creatures are signs for people who are certain [in faith].\n\n**5** (5) And [in] the alternation of night and day and [in] what All?h sends down from the sky of provision [i.e., rain] and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and [in His] directing of the winds are signs for a people who reason.\n\n**6** (6) These are the verses of All?h which We recite to you in truth. Then in what statement after All?h and His verses will they believe?\n\n**7** (7) Woe to every sinful liar\n\n**8** (8) Who hears the verses of All?h recited to him, then persists arrogantly as if he had not heard them.

And this is a confirming Book in an Arabic tongue to warn those who have wronged and as good tidings to the doers of good.\n\n**13** (13) Indeed, those who have said, \"Our Lord is All?h,\" and then remained on a right course - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.\n\n**14** (14) Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding eternally therein as reward for what they used to do.\n\n**15** (15) And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship, and his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty months. [He grows] until, when he reaches maturity and reaches [the age of] forty years, he says, \"My Lord, enable me[1482] to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims.\"\n\n**16** (16) Those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds, [their being] among the companions of Paradise. [That is] the promise of truth which they had been promised.\n\n**17** (17) But one who says to his parents, \"Uff[1483] to you; do you promise me that I will be brought forth [from the earth] when generations before me have already passed on [into oblivion]?\" while they call to All?h for help [and to their son], \"Woe to you! Believe! Indeed, the promise of All?h is truth.\" But he says, \"This is not but legends of the former peoples\" -\n\n**18** (18) Those are the ones upon whom the word [i.e., decree] has come into effect, [who will be] among nations which had passed on before them of jinn and men. Indeed, they [all] were losers.\n\n**19** (19) And for all there are degrees [of reward and punishment] for what they have done, and [it is] so that He may fully compensate them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged.\n\n**2** (2) The revelation of the Book is from All?h, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\n\n**20** (20) And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it will be said], \"You exhausted your pleasures during your worldly life and enjoyed them, so this Day you will be awarded the punishment of [extreme] humiliation because you were arrogant upon the earth without right and because you were defiantly disobedient.\"\n\n**21** (21) And mention, [O Mu?ammad], the brother of ?Aad,[1484] when he warned his people in [the region of] al-A?q?f - and warners had already passed on before him and after him - [saying], \"Do not worship except All?h. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day.\"[1485]\n\n**22** (22) They said, \"Have you come to delude us away from our gods? Then bring us what you promise us, if you should be of the truthful.\"\n\n**23** (23) He said, \"Knowledge [of its time] is only with All?h, and I convey to you that with which I was sent; but I see you [to be] a people behaving ignorantly.\"\n\n**24** (24) And when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys, they said, \"This is a cloud bringing us rain!\" Rather, it is that for which you were impatient:[1486] a wind, within it a painful punishment,\n\n**25** (25) Destroying everything by command of its Lord. And they became so that nothing was seen [of them] except their dwellings. Thus do We recompense the criminal people.\n\n**26** (26) And We had certainly established them in such as We have not established you, and We made for them hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]. But their hearing and vision and hearts availed them not from anything [of the punishment] when they were [continually] rejecting the signs of All?h; and they were enveloped by what they used to ridicule.\n\n**27** (27) And We have already destroyed what surrounds you of [those] cities, and We have diversified the signs [or verses] that perhaps they might return [from disbelief].\n\n**28** (28) Then why did those they took besides All?h as deities by which to approach [Him][1487] not aid them? But they had strayed [i.e., departed] from them.

But those who disbelieve, from that of which they are warned, are turning away.\n\n**30** (30) They said, \"O our people, indeed we have heard a [recited] Book revealed after Moses confirming what was before it which guides to the truth and to a straight path.\n\n**31** (31) O our people, respond to the Caller [i.e., Messenger] of All?h[1488] and believe in him; He [i.e., All?h] will forgive for you your sins and protect you from a painful punishment.\n\n**32** (32) But he who does not respond to the Caller of All?h will not cause failure [to Him] upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in manifest error.\"\n\n**33** (33) Do they not see that All?h, who created the heavens and earth and did not fail in their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Yes. Indeed, He is over all things competent.\n\n**34** (34) And the Day those who disbelieved are exposed to the Fire [it will be said], \"Is this not the truth?\" They will say, \"Yes, by our Lord.\" He will say, \"Then taste the punishment for what you used to deny.\"[1489]\n\n**35** (35) So be patient, [O Mu?ammad], as were those of determination among the messengers and do not be impatient for them.[1490] It will be - on the Day they see that which they are promised - as though they had not remained [in the world] except an hour of a day. [This is] notification. And will [any] be destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people?\n\n**4** (4) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Have you considered that which you invoke besides All?h? Show me what they have created of the earth; or did they have partnership in [creation of] the heavens? Bring me a scripture [revealed] before this or a [remaining] trace of knowledge, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**5** (5) And who is more astray than he who invokes besides All?h those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection [i.e., never], and they, of their invocation, are unaware.\n\n**6** (6) And when the people are gathered [that Day], they [who were invoked] will be enemies to them, and they will be deniers of their worship.\n\n**7** (7) And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidences, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, \"This is obvious magic.\"\n\n**8** (8) Or do they say, \"He has invented it\"? Say, \"If I have invented it, you will not possess for me [the power of protection] from All?h at all. He is most knowing of that in which you are involved.[1478] Sufficient is He as Witness between me and you, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\"\n\n**9** (9) Say, \"I am not something new among the messengers,[1479] nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow that which is revealed to me, and I am not but a clear warner.\""

We destroyed them; and there was no helper for them.\n\n**14** (14) So is he who is on clear evidence from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work has been made attractive and they follow their [own] desires?\n\n**15** (15) Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised, wherein are rivers of water unaltered,[1498] rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all [kinds of] fruits and forgiveness from their Lord... [Are its inhabitants] like those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will sever their intestines?\n\n**16** (16) And among them, [O Mu?ammad], are those who listen to you, until when they depart from you, they say to those who were given knowledge,[1499] \"What has he said just now?\" Those are the ones of whom All?h has sealed over their hearts and who have followed their [own] desires.\n\n**17** (17) And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness.[1500]\n\n**18** (18) Then do they await except that the Hour should come upon them unexpectedly? But already there have come [some of] its indications. Then how [i.e., what good] to them, when it has come, will be their remembrance?\n\n**19** (19) So know, [O Mu?ammad], that there is no deity except All?h and ask forgiveness for your sin[1501] and for the believing men and believing women. And All?h knows of your movement and your resting place.\n\n**2** (2) And those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down upon Mu?ammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition.\n\n**20** (20) Those who believe say, \"Why has a s?rah[1502] not been sent down?\" But when a precise s?rah is revealed and battle is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is disease [i.e., hypocrisy] looking at you with a look of one overcome by death. And more appropriate for them[1503] [would have been]\n\n**21** (21) Obedience and good words. And when the matter [of fighting] was determined, if they had been true to All?h, it would have been better for them.\n\n**22** (22) So would you perhaps, if you turned away,[1504] cause corruption on earth and sever your [ties of] relationship?\n\n**23** (23) Those [who do so] are the ones that All?h has cursed, so He deafened them and blinded their vision.\n\n**24** (24) Then do they not reflect upon the Qur�?n, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?\n\n**25** (25) Indeed, those who reverted back [to disbelief] after guidance had become clear to them - Satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them.\n\n**26** (26) That is because they said to those who disliked what All?h sent down,[1505] \"We will obey you in part of the matter.\" And All?h knows what they conceal.\n\n**27** (27) Then how [will it be] when the angels take them in death, striking their faces and their backs?\n\n**28** (28) That is because they followed what angered All?h and disliked [what earns] His pleasure, so He rendered worthless their deeds.\n\n**29** (29) Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that All?h would never expose their [feelings of] hatred?\n\n**3** (3) That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does All?h present to the people their comparisons.[1493]\n\n**30** (30) And if We willed, We could show them to you, and you would know them by their mark; but you will surely know them by the tone of [their] speech. And All?h knows your deeds.\n\n**31** (31) And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of All?h] and the patient, and We will test your affairs.\n\n**32** (32) Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the path of All?h and opposed the Messenger after guidance had become clear to them - never will they harm All?h at all, and He will render worthless their deeds.\n\n**33** (33) O you who have believed, obey All?h and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds.\n\n**34** (34) Indeed, those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the path of All?h and then died while they were disbelievers - never will All?h forgive them.\n\n**35** (35) So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior; and All?h is with you and will never deprive you of [the reward of] your deeds.\n\n**36** (36) [This] worldly life is only amusement and diversion. And if you believe and fear All?h, He will give you your rewards and not ask you for your properties.\n\n**37** (37) If He should ask you for them and press you, you would withhold, and He would expose your hatred [i.e., unwillingness].\n\n**38** (38) Here you are - those invited to spend in the cause of All?h - but among you are those who withhold [out of greed]. And whoever withholds only withholds [benefit] from himself; and All?h is the Free of need, while you are the needy. And if you turn away [i.e., refuse], He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you.\n\n**4** (4) So when you meet those who disbelieve [in battle], strike [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure [their] bonds,[1494] and either [confer] favor[1495] afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens.[1496] That [is the command]. And if All?h had willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them [Himself], but [He ordered armed struggle] to test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the cause of All?h - never will He waste their deeds.\n\n**5** (5) He will guide them and amend their condition\n\n**6** (6) And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.\n\n**7** (7) O you who have believed, if you support All?h, He will support you and plant firmly your feet.\n\n**8** (8) But those who disbelieve - for them is misery, and He will waste their deeds.\n\n**9** (9) That is because they disliked what All?h revealed, so He rendered worthless their deeds."

    "content": "**1** (1) Indeed, We have given you, [O Mu?ammad], a clear conquest[1507]\n\n**10** (10) Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Mu?ammad] - they are actually pledging allegiance to All?h. The hand[1508] of All?h is over their hands.[1509] So he who breaks his word only breaks it to the detriment of himself. And he who fulfills that which he has promised All?h - He will give him a great reward.\n\n**11** (11) Those who remained behind[1510] of the bedouins will say to you, \"Our properties and our families occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not within their hearts. Say, \"Then who could prevent All?h at all if He intended for you harm or intended for you benefit? Rather, ever is All?h, of what you do, Aware.\n\n**12** (12) But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, ever, and that was made pleasing in your hearts. And you assumed an assumption of evil and became a people ruined.\"\n\n**13** (13) And whoever has not believed in All?h and His Messenger - then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze.\n\n**14** (14) And to All?h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And ever is All?h Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**15** (15) Those who remained[1511] behind will say when you set out toward the war booty to take it, \"Let us follow you.\" They wish to change the words of All?h. Say, \"Never will you follow us. Thus did All?h say before.\" So they will say, \"Rather, you envy us.\" But [in fact] they were not understanding except a little.[1512]\n\n**16** (16) Say to those who remained behind of the bedouins, \"You will be called to [face] a people of great military might; you may fight them, or they will submit.[1513] So if you obey, All?h will give you a good reward; but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.\"\n\n**17** (17) There is not upon the blind any guilt or upon the lame any guilt or upon the ill any guilt [for remaining behind]. And whoever obeys All?h and His Messenger - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoever turns away - He will punish him with a painful punishment.\n\n**18** (18) Certainly was All?h pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, [O Mu?ammad], under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest[1514]\n\n**19** (19) And much war booty which they will take. And ever is All?h Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**2** (2) That All?h may forgive for you what preceded of your sin [i.e., errors] and what will follow and complete His favor upon you and guide you to a straight path\n\n**20** (20) All?h has promised you much booty that you will take [in the future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld the hands of people from you - that it may be a sign for the believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path.\n\n**21** (21) And [He promises] other [victories] that you were [so far] unable to [realize] which All?h has already encompassed.[1515] And ever is All?h, over all things, competent.\n\n**22** (22) And if those [Makkans] who disbelieve had fought you, they would have turned their backs [in flight]. Then they would not find a protector or a helper.\n\n**23** (23) [This is] the established way of All?h which has occurred before. And never will you find in the way of All?h any change.\n\n**24** (24) And it is He who withheld their hands from you and your hands from them within [the area of] Makkah after He caused you to overcome them. And ever is All?h, of what you do, Seeing.\n\n**25** (25) They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al-Masjid al-?ar?m while the offering[1516] was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice. And if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know - that you might trample [i.e., kill] them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without [your] knowledge - [you would have been permitted to enter Makkah]. [This was so] that All?h might admit to His mercy whom He willed. If they had been apart [from them], We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment\n\n**26** (26) When those who disbelieved had put into their hearts chauvinism - the chauvinism of the time of ignorance. But All?h sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and imposed upon them the word of righteousness, and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it. And ever is All?h, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**27** (27) Certainly has All?h showed to His Messenger the vision [i.e., dream] in truth. You will surely enter al-Masjid al-?ar?m, if All?h wills, in safety, with your heads shaved and [hair] shortened,[1517] not fearing [anyone]. He knew what you did not know and has arranged before that a conquest near [at hand].\n\n**28** (28) It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is All?h as Witness.\n\n**29** (29) Mu?ammad is the Messenger of All?h; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from All?h and [His] pleasure. Their sign is in their faces from the effect of prostration [i.e., prayer]. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that He [i.e., All?h] may enrage by them[1518] the disbelievers. All?h has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.\n\n**3** (3) And [that] All?h may aid you with a mighty victory.\n\n**4** (4) It is He who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they would increase in faith along with their [present] faith. And to All?h belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and ever is All?h Knowing and Wise.\n\n**5** (5) [And] that He may admit the believing men and the believing women to gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein eternally and remove from them their misdeeds - and ever is that, in the sight of All?h, a great attainment �\n\n**6** (6) And [that] He may punish the hypocrite men and hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and polytheist women - those who assume about All?h an assumption of evil nature. Upon them is a misfortune of evil nature; and All?h has become angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell, and evil it is as a destination.\n\n**7** (7) And to All?h belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And ever is All?h Exalted in Might and Wise.\n\n**8** (8) Indeed, We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner\n\n**9** (9) That you [people] may believe in All?h and His Messenger and honor him and respect him [i.e., the Prophet (?)] and exalt Him [i.e., All?h] morning and afternoon."

Indeed, All?h is Hearing and Knowing.\n\n**10** (10) The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers. And fear All?h that you may receive mercy.\n\n**11** (11) O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames. Wretched is the name [i.e., mention] of disobedience after [one's] faith. And whoever does not repent - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.\n\n**12** (12) O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it. And fear All?h; indeed, All?h is Accepting of Repentance and Merciful.\n\n**13** (13) O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of All?h is the most righteous[1521] of you. Indeed, All?h is Knowing and Aware.\n\n**14** (14) The bedouins say, \"We have believed.\" Say, \"You have not [yet] believed; but say [instead], 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey All?h and His Messenger, He will not deprive you from your deeds[1522] of anything. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\"\n\n**15** (15) The believers are only the ones who have believed in All?h and His Messenger and then doubt not but strive with their properties and their lives in the cause of All?h. It is those who are the truthful.\n\n**16** (16) Say, \"Would you acquaint All?h with your religion while All?h knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and All?h is Knowing of all things?\"\n\n**17** (17) They consider it a favor to you that they have accepted Isl?m. Say, \"Do not consider your Isl?m a favor to me. Rather, All?h has conferred favor upon you that He has guided you to the faith, if you should be truthful.\"\n\n**18** (18) Indeed, All?h knows the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And All?h is Seeing of what you do.\n\n**2** (2) O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not.\n\n**3** (3) Indeed, those who lower their voices before the Messenger of All?h - they are the ones whose hearts All?h has tested for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and great reward.\n\n**4** (4) Indeed, those who call you, [O Mu?ammad], from behind the chambers - most of them do not use reason.\n\n**5** (5) And if they had been patient until you [could] come out to them, it would have been better for them. But All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**6** (6) O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful.\n\n**7** (7) And know that among you is the Messenger of All?h. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be in difficulty, but All?h has endeared to you the faith and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, defiance and disobedience. Those are the [rightly] guided.\n\n**8** (8) [It is] as bounty from All?h and favor. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**9** (9) And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of All?h. And if it returns, then make settlement between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, All?h loves those who act justly."

Is there any place of escape?\n\n**37** (37) Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or who listens while he is present [in mind].\n\n**38** (38) And We did certainly create the heavens and earth and what is between them in six days, and there touched Us no weariness.\n\n**39** (39) So be patient, [O Mu?ammad], over what they say and exalt [All?h] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting,\n\n**4** (4) We know what the earth diminishes [i.e., consumes] of them, and with Us is a retaining record.\n\n**40** (40) And [in part] of the night exalt Him and after prostration [i.e., prayer].\n\n**41** (41) And listen on the Day when the Caller[1532] will call out from a place that is near -\n\n**42** (42) The Day they will hear the blast [of the Horn] in truth.

Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.\n\n**52** (52) Similarly, there came not to those before them any messenger except that they said, \"A magician or a madman.\"\n\n**53** (53) Did they suggest it to them?[1547] Rather, they [themselves] are a transgressing people.\n\n**54** (54) So leave them, [O Mu?ammad], for you are not to be blamed.\n\n**55** (55) And remind, for indeed, the reminder benefits the believers.\n\n**56** (56) And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.\n\n**57** (57) I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me.\n\n**58** (58) Indeed, it is All?h who is the [continual] Provider,[1548] the firm possessor of strength.\n\n**59** (59) And indeed, for those who have wronged is a portion [of punishment] like the portion of their companions [i.e., predecessors], so let them not impatiently urge Me.\n\n**6** (6) And indeed, the recompense is to occur.\n\n**60** (60) And woe to those who have disbelieved from their Day which they are promised.\n\n**7** (7) By the heaven containing pathways,[1535]\n\n**8** (8) Indeed, you are in differing speech.[1536]\n\n**9** (9) Deluded away from it [i.e., the Qur�?n] is he who is deluded."

Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest [of Makkah] and fought [and those who did so after it]. Those are greater in degree than they who spent afterwards and fought. But to all All?h has promised the best [reward]. And All?h, of what you do, is Aware.\n\n**11** (11) Who is it that would loan All?h a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward?\n\n**12** (12) On the Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right, [it will be said], \"Your good tidings today are [of] gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein you will abide eternally.\" That is what is the great attainment.\n\n**13** (13) On the [same] Day the hypocrite men and hypocrite women will say to those who believed, \"Wait for us that we may acquire some of your light.\" It will be said, \"Go back behind you[1630] and seek light.\" And a wall will be placed between them with a door, its interior containing mercy, but on the outside of it is torment.\n\n**14** (14) They [i.e., the hypocrites] will call to them [i.e., the believers], \"Were we not with you?\" They will say, \"Yes, but you afflicted yourselves[1631] and awaited [misfortune for us] and doubted, and wishful thinking deluded you until there came the command of All?h. And the Deceiver [i.e., Satan] deceived you concerning All?h.\n\n**15** (15) So today no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved. Your refuge is the Fire. It is most worthy of you, and wretched is the destination.\"\n\n**16** (16) Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of All?h and what has come down of the truth? And let them not be like those who were given the Scripture before, and a long period passed over them, so their hearts hardened; and many of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**17** (17) Know that All?h gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. We have made clear to you the signs; perhaps you will understand.[1632]\n\n**18** (18) Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned All?h a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward.\n\n**19** (19) And those who have believed in All?h and His messengers - those are [in the ranks of] the supporters of truth and the martyrs, with their Lord. For them is their reward and their light.[1633] But those who have disbelieved and denied Our verses - those are the companions of Hellfire.\n\n**2** (2) His is the dominion of the heavens and earth. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent.\n\n**20** (20) Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children - like the example of a rain whose [resulting] plant growth pleases the tillers; then it dries and you see it turned yellow; then it becomes [scattered] debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from All?h and approval. And what is the worldly life except the enjoyment of delusion.\n\n**21** (21) Race [i.e., compete] toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heavens and earth, prepared for those who believed in All?h and His messengers. That is the bounty of All?h which He gives to whom He wills, and All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**22** (22) No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register[1634] before We bring it into being - indeed that, for All?h, is easy -\n\n**23** (23) In order that you not despair over what has eluded you and not exult [in pride] over what He has given you. And All?h does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful -\n\n**24** (24) [Those] who are stingy and enjoin upon people stinginess. And whoever turns away[1635] - then indeed, All?h is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**25** (25) We have already sent Our messengers with clear evidences and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that the people may maintain [their affairs] in justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people, and so that All?h may make evident those who support Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, All?h is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n\n**26** (26) And We have already sent Noah and Abraham and placed in their descendants prophethood and scripture; and among them is he who is guided, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**27** (27) Then We sent following their footsteps [i.e., traditions] Our messengers and followed [them] with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy and monasticism, which they innovated; We did not prescribe it for them except [that they did so] seeking the approval of All?h. But they did not observe it with due observance. So We gave the ones who believed among them their reward, but many of them are defiantly disobedient.\n\n**28** (28) O you who have believed, fear All?h and believe in His Messenger; He will [then] give you a double portion of His mercy and make for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you; and All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**29** (29) [This is] so that the People of the Scripture may know that they are not able [to obtain] anything from the bounty of All?h[1636] and that [all] bounty is in the hand[1637] of All?h; He gives it to whom He wills. And All?h is the possessor of great bounty.\n\n**3** (3) He is the First[1623] and the Last,[1624] the Ascendant[1625] and the Intimate,[1626] and He is, of all things, Knowing.\n\n**4** (4) It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne.[1627] He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein; and He is with you[1628] wherever you are. And All?h, of what you do, is Seeing.\n\n**5** (5) His is the dominion of the heavens and earth. And to All?h are returned [all] matters.\n\n**6** (6) He causes the night to enter the day and causes the day to enter the night, and He is Knowing of that within the breasts.\n\n**7** (7) Believe in All?h and His Messenger and spend out of that in which He has made you successive inheritors. For those who have believed among you and spent,[1629] there will be a great reward.\n\n**8** (8) And why do you not believe in All?h while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your covenant, if you should [truly] be believers?\n\n**9** (9) It is He who sends down upon His Servant [Mu?ammad (?)] verses of clear evidence that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And indeed, All?h is to you Kind and Merciful."

Their mothers are none but those who gave birth to them. And indeed, they are saying an objectionable statement and a falsehood. But indeed, All?h is Pardoning and Forgiving.\n\n**20** (20) Indeed, the ones who oppose All?h and His Messenger - those will be among the most humbled.\n\n**21** (21) All?h has written [i.e., decreed], \"I will surely overcome, I and My messengers.\" Indeed, All?h is Powerful and Exalted in Might.\n\n**22** (22) You will not find a people who believe in All?h and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose All?h and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred.

That is what you are admonished thereby; and All?h is Aware of what you do.\n\n**4** (4) And he who does not find [a slave] - then a fast for two months consecutively[1640] before they touch one another; and he who is unable - then the feeding of sixty poor persons.

Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful.\"\n\n**11** (11) Have you not considered those who practice hypocrisy, saying to their brothers [i.e., associates] who have disbelieved among the People of the Scripture, \"If you are expelled, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey, in regard to you, anyone - ever; and if you are fought, we will surely aid you.\" But All?h testifies that they are liars.\n\n**12** (12) If they are expelled, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them. And [even] if they should aid them, they will surely turn their backs; then [thereafter] they will not be aided.\n\n**13** (13) You [believers] are more fearful within their breasts than All?h. That is because they are a people who do not understand.\n\n**14** (14) They will not fight you all except within fortified cities or from behind walls. Their violence [i.e., enmity] among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not reason.\n\n**15** (15) [Theirs is] like the example of those shortly before them: they tasted the bad consequence of their affair, and they will have a painful punishment.\n\n**16** (16) [The hypocrites are] like the example of Satan when he says to man, \"Disbelieve.\" But when he disbelieves, he says, \"Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I fear All?h, Lord of the worlds.\"\n\n**17** (17) So the outcome for both of them is that they will be in the Fire, abiding eternally therein. And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers.\n\n**18** (18) O you who have believed, fear All?h. And let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow - and fear All?h. Indeed, All?h is Aware of what you do.\n\n**19** (19) And be not like those who forgot All?h, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**2** (2) It is He who expelled the ones who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture[1651] from their homes at the first gathering.[1652] You did not think they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from All?h; but [the decree of] All?h came upon them from where they had not expected, and He cast terror into their hearts [so] they destroyed their houses by their [own] hands and the hands of the believers. So take warning, O people of vision.\n\n**20** (20) Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise. The companions of Paradise - they are the attainers [of success].\n\n**21** (21) If We had sent down this Qur�?n upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of All?h. And these examples We present to the people that perhaps they will give thought.\n\n**22** (22) He is All?h, other than whom there is no deity, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed.[1657] He is the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.\n\n**23** (23) He is All?h, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign,[1658] the Pure,[1659] the Perfection,[1660] the Grantor of Security,[1661] the Overseer,[1662] the Exalted in Might,[1663] the Compeller,[1664] the Superior.[1665] Exalted is All?h above whatever they associate with Him.\n\n**24** (24) He is All?h, the Creator,[1666] the Producer,[1667] the Fashioner;[1668] to Him belong the best names.[1669] Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.[1670]\n\n**3** (3) And if not that All?h had decreed for them evacuation, He would have punished them in [this] world, and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire.\n\n**4** (4) That is because they opposed All?h and His Messenger. And whoever opposes All?h - then indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**5** (5) Whatever you have cut down of [their] palm trees or left standing on their trunks - it was by permission of All?h and so He would disgrace the defiantly disobedient.\n\n**6** (6) And what All?h restored [of property] to His Messenger from them - you did not spur for it [in an expedition] any horses or camels,[1653] but All?h gives His messengers power over whom He wills, and All?h is over all things competent.\n\n**7** (7) And what All?h restored to His Messenger from the people of the towns - it is for All?h and for the Messenger and for [his] near relatives[1654] and orphans and the needy and the [stranded] traveler[1655] - so that it will not be a perpetual distribution among the rich from among you. And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear All?h; indeed, All?h is severe in penalty.\n\n**8** (8) For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from All?h and [His] approval and supporting [the cause of] All?h and His Messenger, [there is also a share]. Those are the truthful.\n\n**9** (9) And [also for] those who were settled in the Home [i.e.,al-Mad?nah] and [adopted] the faith before them.[1656] They love those who emigrated to them and find not any want in their breasts of what they [i.e., the emigrants] were given but give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful."

If you have come out for jih?d [i.e., fighting or striving] in My cause and seeking means to My approval, [take them not as friends]. You confide to them affection [i.e., instruction], but I am most knowing of what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does it among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.\n\n**10** (10) O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as emigrants, examine [i.e., test] them. All?h is most knowing as to their faith. And if you know them to be believers, then do not return them to the disbelievers; they are not lawful [wives] for them, nor are they lawful [husbands] for them. But give them [i.e., the disbelievers] what they have spent.[1676] And there is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation [i.e., mahr]. And hold not to marriage bonds with disbelieving women, but ask for what you have spent and let them [i.e., the disbelievers] ask for what they have spent.[1677] That is the judgement of All?h; He judges between you. And All?h is Knowing and Wise.\n\n**11** (11) And if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain [something],[1678] then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent. And fear All?h, in whom you are believers.\n\n**12** (12) O Prophet, when the believing women come to you pledging to you that they will not associate anything with All?h, nor will they steal, nor will they commit unlawful sexual intercourse, nor will they kill their children, nor will they bring forth a slander they have invented between their arms and legs,[1679] nor will they disobey you in what is right - then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them of All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**13** (13) O you who have believed, do not make allies of a people with whom All?h has become angry. They have despaired of [reward in] the Hereafter just as the disbelievers have despaired of [meeting] the companions [i.e., inhabitants] of the graves.\n\n**2** (2) If they gain dominance over you, they would be [i.e., behave] to you as enemies and extend against you their hands and their tongues with evil, and they wish you would disbelieve.\n\n**3** (3) Never will your relatives or your children benefit you; the Day of Resurrection He will judge between you. And All?h, of what you do, is Seeing.\n\n**4** (4) There has already been for you an excellent pattern[1673] in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, \"Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than All?h. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in All?h alone\" - except for the saying of Abraham to his father, \"I will surely ask forgiveness for you, but I have not [power to do] for you anything against All?h. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned, and to You is the destination.\n\n**5** (5) Our Lord, make us not [objects of] torment for the disbelievers and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\"\n\n**6** (6) There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in All?h and the Last Day. And whoever turns away - then indeed, All?h is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.\n\n**7** (7) Perhaps All?h will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And All?h is competent,[1674] and All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**8** (8) All?h does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, All?h loves those who act justly.\n\n**9** (9) All?h only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - [forbids] that you make allies[1675] of them. And whoever makes allies of them, then it is those who are the wrongdoers."

All?h has sent down to you a message [i.e., the Qur�?n].[1704]\n\n**11** (11) [He sent] a Messenger [i.e., Mu?ammad (?)] reciting to you the distinct verses of All?h that He may bring out those who believe and do righteous deeds from darknesses into the light.

The disbelievers are not but in delusion.\n\n**21** (21) Or who is it that could provide for you if He withheld His provision? But they have persisted in insolence and aversion.\n\n**22** (22) Then is one who walks fallen on his face better guided or one who walks erect on a straight path?\n\n**23** (23) Say, \"It is He who has produced you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts [i.e., intellect]; little are you grateful.\"\n\n**24** (24) Say, \"It is He who has multiplied you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered.\"\n\n**25** (25) And they say, \"When is this promise, if you should be truthful?\"\n\n**26** (26) Say, \"The knowledge is only with All?h, and I am only a clear warner.\"\n\n**27** (27) But when they see it[1720] approaching, the faces of those who disbelieve will be distressed, and it will be said, \"This is that for which you used to call.\"[1721]\n\n**28** (28) Say, [O Mu?ammad], \"Have you considered:[1722] whether All?h should cause my death and those with me or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?\"\n\n**29** (29) Say, \"He is the Most Merciful; we have believed in Him, and upon Him we have relied.

And All?h determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it[1785] and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Qur�?n. He has known that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling throughout the land seeking [something] of the bounty of All?h and others fighting for the cause of All?h. So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zak?h and loan All?h a goodly loan.[1786] And whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with All?h. It is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of All?h. Indeed, All?h is Forgiving and Merciful.\n\n**3** (3) Half of it - or subtract from it a little\n\n**4** (4) Or add to it, and recite the Qur�?n with measured recitation.\n\n**5** (5) Indeed, We will cast upon you a heavy word.[1779]\n\n**6** (6) Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue][1780] and more suitable for words.[1781]\n\n**7** (7) Indeed, for you by day is prolonged occupation.\n\n**8** (8) And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with [complete] devotion.\n\n**9** (9) [He is] the Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of [your] affairs.[1782]"
