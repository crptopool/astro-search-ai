# Surah 56: The Inevitable (Al-Waqi'ah)

**1.** 1. When the Event (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) befalls.

**2.** 2. And there can be no denial of its befalling.

**3.** 3. Bringing low (some - those who will enter Hell) Exalting (others - those who will enter Paradise). [Tafsir Ibn Kathir]

**4.** 4. When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.

**5.** 5. And the mountains will be powdered to dust,

**6.** 6. So that they will become floating dust particles.

**7.** 7. And you (all) will be in three groups.

**8.** 8. So those on the Right Hand (i.e. those who will be given their Records in their right hands) - how (fortunate) will be those on the Right Hand! (As a respect for them, because they will enter Paradise).

**9.** 9. And those on the Left Hand (i.e. those who will be given their Record in their left hands) - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand! (As a disgrace for them, because they will enter Hell).

**10.** 10. And those foremost [(in Isl�mic Faith of Monotheism and in performing righteous deeds) in the life of this world on the very first call for to embrace Isl�m] will be foremost (in Paradise).

**11.** 11. These will be the nearest (to All�h).

**12.** 12. In the Gardens of Delight (Paradise).

**13.** 13. A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first generations (who embraced Isl�m).

**14.** 14. And a few of those (foremost) will be from the later generations.

**15.** 15. (They will be) on thrones woven with gold and precious stones.

**16.** 16. Reclining thereon, face to face.

**17.** 17. Immortal boys will go around them (serving),

**18.** 18. With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine,

**19.** 19. Wherefrom they will get neither any aching of the head, nor any intoxication.

**20.** 20. And with fruit that they may choose.

**21.** 21. And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.

**22.** 22. And (there will be) H�r (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes (as wives for "Al-Muttaq�n" - the pious - See V. 2:2),

**23.** 23. Like unto preserved pearls.

**24.** 24. A reward for what they used to do.

**25.** 25. No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (like backbiting).

**26.** 26. But only the saying of: Sal�m! Sal�m! (greetings with peace)![1]

**27.** 27. And those on the Right Hand - how (fortunate) will be those on the Right Hand?

**28.** 28. (They will be) among thornless lote-trees,

**29.** 29. And among Talh (banana-trees) with fruits piled one above another,

**30.** 30. And in shade long-extended,

**31.** 31. And by water flowing constantly,

**32.** 32. And fruit in plenty,

**33.** 33. Whose supply is not cut off (by change of season), nor are they out of reach,

**34.** 34. And on couches or thrones, raised high.

**35.** 35. Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.

**36.** 36. And made them virgins.

**37.** 37. Loving (their husbands only), (and) of equal age.

**38.** 38. For those on the Right Hand.

**39.** 39. A multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the first generation (who embraced Isl�m).

**40.** 40. And a multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the later generations.

**41.** 41. And those on the Left Hand - how (unfortunate) will be those on the Left Hand?

**42.** 42. In fierce hot wind and boiling water,

**43.** 43. And shadow of black smoke,

**44.** 44. (That shadow) neither cool, nor (even) pleasant,

**45.** 45. Verily, before that, they indulged in luxury,

**46.** 46. And were persisting in great sin (joining partners in worship along with All�h, committing murder and other crimes)[2]

**47.** 47. And they used to say: "When we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be resurrected?

**48.** 48. "And also our forefathers?"

**49.** 49. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "(Yes) verily, those of old, and those of later times.

**50.** 50. "All will surely be gathered together for appointed Meeting of a known Day.

**51.** 51. "Then moreover, verily you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)!

**52.** 52. "You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqq�m.

**53.** 53. "Then you will fill your bellies therewith,

**54.** 54. "And drink boiling water on top of it.

**55.** 55. "And you will drink (that) like thirsty camels!"

**56.** 56. That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!

**57.** 57. We created you: then why do you believe not?

**58.** 58. Then tell Me (about) the (human) semen that you emit.

**59.** 59. Is it you who create it (i.e. make this semen into a perfect human being), or are We the Creator?

**60.** 60. We have decreed death to you all, and We are not outstripped,

**61.** 61. To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.

**62.** 62. And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation (i.e. the creation of Adam): why then do you not remember (or take heed)?

**63.** 63. Then tell Me about the seed that you sow in the ground.

**64.** 64. Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?

**65.** 65. Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry pieces, and you would be regretful (or left in wonderment) [Tafsir Ibn Kath�r].

**66.** 66. (Saying): "We are indeed Mughram�n (i.e. ruined or have lost the money without any profit, or are punished by the loss of all that we spend for cultivation)! (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�)

**67.** 67. "Nay, but we are deprived!"

**68.** 68. Then tell Me about the water that you drink.

**69.** 69. Is it you who cause it from the rain-clouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?

**70.** 70. If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable): why then do you not give thanks (to All�h)?

**71.** 71. Then tell Me about the fire which you kindle.

**72.** 72. Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?

**73.** 73. We have made it a Reminder (of the Hell-fire in the Hereafter), and an article of use for the travellers (and all the others, in this world).

**74.** 74. Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.

**75.** 75. So I swear by the setting of the stars.[1]

**76.** 76. And verily that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.

**77.** 77. That (this) is indeed an honourable recitation (the Noble Qur��n).

**78.** 78. In a Book well-guarded (with All�h in the heaven i.e. Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z ).

**79.** 79. Which (that Book with All�h) none can touch but the purified (i.e. the angels).

**80.** 80. A Revelation (this Qur��n) from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**81.** 81. Is it such a talk (this Qur��n) that you (disbelievers) deny?

**82.** 82. And instead (of thanking All�h) for the provision He gives you, you deny (Him by disbelief)!

**83.** 83. Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat?

**84.** 84. And you at the moment are looking on,

**85.** 85. But We (i.e. Our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not, (Tafsir At-Tabar�)

**86.** 86. Then why do you not - if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense (punishment) -

**87.** 87. Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful?

**88.** 88. Then, if he (the dying person) be of the Muqarrab�n (those brought near to All�h),

**89.** 89. (There is for him) rest and provision, and a Garden of Delights (Paradise).

**90.** 90. And if he (the dying person) be of those on the Right Hand,

**91.** 91. Then there is safety and peace (from the Punishment of All�h) for those on the right Hand.

**92.** 92. But if he (the dying person) be of the denying (of the Resurrection), the erring (away from the Right Path of Isl�mic Monotheism),

**93.** 93. Then for him is an entertainment with boiling water.

**94.** 94. And burning in Hell-fire.

**95.** 95. Verily, this! This is an absolute Truth with certainty.

**96.** 96. So glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
