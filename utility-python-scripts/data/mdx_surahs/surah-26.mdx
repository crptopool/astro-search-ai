# Surah 26: The Poets (Ash-Shu'ara)

**1.** 1. T�-S�n-M�m.

**2.** 2. These are the Verses of the manifest Book [(this Qur��n), which was promised by All�h in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), makes things clear].

**3.** 3. It may be that you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) are going to kill yourself with grief, that they do not become believers [in your Risalah (Messengership) i.e. in your Message of Isl�mic Monotheism].[1]

**4.** 4. If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.

**5.** 5. And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Gracious (All�h), but they turn away therefrom.

**6.** 6. So they have indeed denied (the truth - this Qur��n), then the news of what they mocked at will come to them.

**7.** 7. Do they not observe the earth - how much of every good kind We cause to grow therein?

**8.** 8. Verily, in this is an Ay�h (proof or sign), yet most of them (polytheists, pagans who do not believe in Resurrection) are not believers.

**9.** 9. And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**10.** 10. And (remember) when your Lord called M�s� (Moses) (saying): "Go to the people who are Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers) -

**11.** 11. "The people of Fir�aun (Pharaoh): Will they not fear All�h and become righteous?"

**12.** 12. He said: "My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will belie me,

**13.** 13. "And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for H�r�n (Aaron) (to come along with me).

**14.** 14. "And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me."

**15.** 15. (All�h) said: "Nay! Go you both with Our Signs. Verily We shall be with you, listening.

**16.** 16. "And go both of you to Fir�aun (Pharaoh), and say: �We are the Messengers of the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists),

**17.** 17. "So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.� "

**18.** 18. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said [to M�s� (Moses)]: "Did we not bring you up among us as a child? And you did dwell many years of your life with us.

**19.** 19. "And you did your deed, which you did (i.e. the crime of killing a man) while you were one of the ingrates."

**20.** 20. M�s� (Moses) said: "I did it then, when I was ignorant (as regards my Lord and His Message).

**21.** 21. "So I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukm (i.e. religious knowledge, right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood), and made me one of the Messengers.

**22.** 22. "And this is the past favour with which you reproach me: that you have enslaved the Children of Israel."

**23.** 23. Fir�aun (Pharaoh) said: "And what is the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?"

**24.** 24. [M�s� (Moses)] said: "The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty."

**25.** 25. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said to those around: "Do you not hear (what he says)?"

**26.** 26. [M�s� (Moses)] said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!"

**27.** 27. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said: "Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!"

**28.** 28. [M�s� (Moses)] said: "Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!"

**29.** 29. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said: "If you choose an il�h (god) other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners."

**30.** 30. [M�s� (Moses)] said: "Even if I bring you something manifest (and convincing)?"

**31.** 31. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said: "Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!"

**32.** 32. So [M�s� (Moses)] threw his stick, and behold, it was a serpent, manifest.

**33.** 33. And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!

**34.** 34. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said to the chiefs around him: "Verily! This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer.

**35.** 35. "He wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery: what is it then that you command?"

**36.** 36. They said: "Put him off and his brother (for a while), and send callers to the cities;

**37.** 37. "To bring up to you every well-versed sorcerer."

**38.** 38. So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time on a day appointed.

**39.** 39. And it was said to the people: "Are you (too) going to assemble?

**40.** 40. "That we may follow the sorcerers [who were on Fir�aun�s (Pharaoh) religion of disbelief] if they are the winners."

**41.** 41. So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Fir�aun (Pharaoh): "Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners?"

**42.** 42. He said: "Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near (to myself)."

**43.** 43. M�s� (Moses) said to them: "Throw what you are going to throw!"

**44.** 44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: "By the might of Fir�aun (Pharaoh), it is we who will certainly win!"

**45.** 45. Then M�s� (Moses) threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all that they falsely showed!

**46.** 46. And the sorcerers fell down prostrate.

**47.** 47. Saying: "We believe in the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**48.** 48. "The Lord of M�s� (Moses) and H�r�n (Aaron)."

**49.** 49. [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] said: "You have believed in him before I give you leave. Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic! So verily, you shall come to know. Verily, I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all."

**50.** 50. They said: "No harm! Surely, to our Lord (All�h) we are to return.

**51.** 51. "Verily we really hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first of the believers [in M�s� (Moses) and in the Monotheism which he has brought from All�h]."

**52.** 52. And We revealed to M�s� (Moses), saying: "Depart by night with My slaves, verily you will be pursued."

**53.** 53. Then Fir�aun (Pharaoh) sent callers to (all) the cities.

**54.** 54. (Saying): "Verily these indeed are but a small band.

**55.** 55. "And verily, they have done what has enraged us.

**56.** 56. "But we are a host all assembled, amply fore-warned."

**57.** 57. So, We expelled them from gardens and springs,

**58.** 58. Treasures, and every kind of honourable place.

**59.** 59. Thus [We turned them (Pharaoh�s people) out] and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.

**60.** 60. So they pursued them at sunrise.

**61.** 61. And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of M�s� (Moses) said: "We are sure to be overtaken."

**62.** 62. [M�s� (Moses)] said: "Nay, verily with me is my Lord. He will guide me."

**63.** 63. Then We revealed to M�s� (Moses) (saying): "Strike the sea with your stick." And it parted, and each separate part (of that sea water) became like huge mountain.

**64.** 64. Then We brought near the others [Fir�aun�s (Pharaoh) party] to that place.

**65.** 65. And We saved M�s� (Moses) and all those with him.

**66.** 66. Then We drowned the others.

**67.** 67. Verily in this is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers.

**68.** 68. And verily your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**69.** 69. And recite to them the story of Ibr�h�m (Abraham).

**70.** 70. When he said to his father and his people: "What do you worship?"

**71.** 71. They said: "We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted."

**72.** 72. He said: "Do they hear you, when you call on (them)?

**73.** 73. "Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)?"

**74.** 74. They said: "(Nay) but we found our fathers doing so."

**75.** 75. He said: "Do you observe that which you have been worshipping -

**76.** 76. "You and your ancient fathers?

**77.** 77. "Verily they are enemies to me, save the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists),

**78.** 78. "Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me.

**79.** 79. "And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink.

**80.** 80. "And when I am ill, it is He who cures me.

**81.** 81. "And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again).

**82.** 82. "And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Recompense, (the Day of Resurrection).

**83.** 83. My Lord! Bestow Hukm (religious knowledge, right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood) on me, and join me with the righteous.

**84.** 84. And grant me an honourable mention in later generations.

**85.** 85. And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight.

**86.** 86. And forgive my father, verily he is of the erring.

**87.** 87. And disgrace me not on the Day when (all the creatures) will be resurrected.

**88.** 88. The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,

**89.** 89. Except him who brings to All�h a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nif�q (hypocrisy)]."

**90.** 90. And Paradise will be brought near to the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**91.** 91. And the (Hell) Fire will be placed in full view of the erring.

**92.** 92. And it will be said to them: "Where are those (the false gods whom you used to set up as rivals with All�h) that you used to worship.

**93.** 93. "Instead of All�h? Can they help you or (even) help themselves?"

**94.** 94. Then they will be thrown on their faces into the (Fire), they and the Gh�w�n (devils, and those who were in error).

**95.** 95. And the whole hosts of Ibl�s (Satan) together.

**96.** 96. They will say while contending therein,

**97.** 97. By All�h, we were truly in a manifest error,

**98.** 98. When We held you (false gods) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists);

**99.** 99. And none has brought us into error except the Mujrim�n [Ibl�s (Satan) and those of human beings who commit crimes, murderers, polytheists, oppressors].

**100.** 100. Now we have no intercessors,

**101.** 101. Nor a close friend (to help us).

**102.** 102. (Alas!) If we only had a chance to return (to the world), we shall truly be among the believers!

**103.** 103. Verily in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**104.** 104. And verily, your Lord, He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**105.** 105. The people of N�h (Noah) belied the Messengers.

**106.** 106. When their brother N�h (Noah) said to them: "Will you not fear All�h and obey Him?

**107.** 107. "I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.

**108.** 108. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**109.** 109. "No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Isl�mic Monotheism); my reward is only from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**110.** 110. "So keep your duty to All�h, fear Him and obey me."

**111.** 111. They said: "Shall we believe in you, when the meanest (of the people) follow you?"

**112.** 112. He said: "And what knowledge have I of what they used to do?

**113.** 113. "Their account is only with my Lord, if you could (but) know.

**114.** 114. "And I am not going to drive away the believers.

**115.** 115. I am only a plain warner."

**116.** 116. They said: "If you cease not, O N�h (Noah) you will surely be among those stoned (to death)."

**117.** 117. He said: "My Lord! Verily, my people have belied me.

**118.** 118. Therefore judge You between me and them, and save me and those of the believers who are with me."

**119.** 119. And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.

**120.** 120. Then We drowned the rest (disbelievers) thereafter.

**121.** 121. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**122.** 122. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**123.** 123. ��d (people) belied the Messengers.

**124.** 124. When their brother H�d said to them: "Will you not fear All�h and obey Him?

**125.** 125. "Verily I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.

**126.** 126. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**127.** 127. "No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Isl�mic Monotheism); my reward is only from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).

**128.** 128. "Do you build high palaces on every high place, while you do not live in them?

**129.** 129. "And do you get for yourselves palaces (fine buildings) as if you will live therein for ever.[1]

**130.** 130. "And when you seize (somebody), seize you (him) as tyrants?

**131.** 131. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**132.** 132. "And keep your duty to Him, fear Him Who has aided you with all (good things) that you know.

**133.** 133. "He has aided you with cattle and children.

**134.** 134. "And gardens and springs.

**135.** 135. "Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day."

**136.** 136. They said: "It is the same to us whether you preach or be not of those who preach.

**137.** 137. "This is no other than the false tales and religion of the ancients, [Tafsir At-Tabar�]

**138.** 138. "And we are not going to be punished."

**139.** 139. So they belied him, and We destroyed them. Verily in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**140.** 140. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**141.** 141. Tham�d (people) belied the Messengers.

**142.** 142. When their brother S�lih said to them: "Will you not fear All�h and obey Him?

**143.** 143. "I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.

**144.** 144. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**145.** 145. "No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Isl�mic Monotheism); my reward is only from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**146.** 146. "Will you be left secure in that which you have here?

**147.** 147. "In gardens and springs.

**148.** 148. And green crops (fields) and date-palms with soft spadix.

**149.** 149. "And you hew out in the mountains, houses with great skill.

**150.** 150. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**151.** 151. "And follow not the command of Al-Musrif�n [i.e. their chiefs: leaders who were polytheists, criminals and sinners],

**152.** 152. "Who make mischief in the land, and reform not."

**153.** 153. They said: "You are only of those bewitched!

**154.** 154. "You are but a human being like us. Then bring us a sign if you are of the truthful."

**155.** 155. He said: "Here is a she-camel: it has a right to drink (water), and you have a right to drink (water) (each) on a day, known.

**156.** 156. "And touch her not with harm, lest the torment of a Great Day should seize you."

**157.** 157. But they killed her, and then they became regretful.

**158.** 158. So the torment overtook them. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**159.** 159. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**160.** 160. The people of L�t (Lot) (-who dwelt in the town of Sodom in Palestine) belied the Messengers.

**161.** 161. When their brother L�t (Lot) said to them: "Will you not fear All�h and obey Him?

**162.** 162. "Verily I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.

**163.** 163. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**164.** 164. "No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Isl�mic Monotheism); my reward is only from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**165.** 165. "Go you in unto the males of the ��lam�n (mankind),

**166.** 166. "And leave those whom All�h has created for you to be your wives? Nay, you are a trespassing people!"

**167.** 167. They said: "If you cease not O L�t (Lot)! verily, you will be one of those who are driven out!"

**168.** 168. He said: "I am, indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury your (this evil) action (of sodomy).

**169.** 169. "My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do."

**170.** 170. So We saved him and his family, all,

**171.** 171. Except an old woman (his wife) among those who remained behind.

**172.** 172. Then afterward We destroyed the others.

**173.** 173. And We rained on them a rain (of torment). And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned!

**174.** 174. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**175.** 175. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**176.** 176. The dwellers of Al-Aikah [near Madyan (Midian)] belied the Messengers.

**177.** 177. When Shu�aib said to them: "Will you not fear All�h (and obey Him)?

**178.** 178. "I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.

**179.** 179. "So fear All�h, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.

**180.** 180. "No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Isl�mic Monotheism); my reward is only from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**181.** 181. "Give full measure, and cause no loss (to others).

**182.** 182. "And weigh with the true and straight balance.

**183.** 183. "And defraud not people by reducing their things, nor do evil, making corruption and mischief in the land.

**184.** 184. "And fear Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old."

**185.** 185. They said: "You are only one of those bewitched!

**186.** 186. "You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!

**187.** 187. "So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!"

**188.** 188. He said: "My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do."

**189.** 189. But they belied him, so the torment of the day of shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.

**190.** 190. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.

**191.** 191. And verily your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.

**192.** 192. And truly, this (the Qur��n) is a revelation from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists),

**193.** 193. Which the trustworthy R�h [Jibr�l (Gabriel)] has brought down

**194.** 194. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) that you may be (one) of the warners,

**195.** 195. In the plain Arabic language.

**196.** 196. And verily, it (the Qur��n, and its revelation to Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is (announced) in the Scriptures [i.e. the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] of former people.

**197.** 197. Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars (like �Abdull�h bin Sal�m ??? ???? ??? who embraced Isl�m)[1] of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)?

**198.** 198. And if We had revealed it (this Qur��n) unto any of the non-Arabs,

**199.** 199. And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.

**200.** 200. Thus have We caused it (the denial of the Qur��n) to enter the hearts of the M�jrim�n (criminals, polytheists, sinners).

**201.** 201. They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment.

**202.** 202. It shall come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not.

**203.** 203. Then they will say: "Can we be respited?"

**204.** 204. Would they then wish for Our Torment to be hastened on?

**205.** 205. Tell Me, (even) if We do let them enjoy for years,

**206.** 206. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised,

**207.** 207. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them.

**208.** 208. And never did We destroy a township but it had its warners

**209.** 209. By way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.

**210.** 210. And it is not the Shay�t�n (devils) who have brought it (this Qur��n) down.

**211.** 211. Neither would it suit them, nor they can (produce it).

**212.** 212. Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.

**213.** 213. So invoke not with All�h another il�h (god) lest you should be among those who receive punishment.

**214.** 214. And warn your tribe (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) of near kindred.[1]

**215.** 215. And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.

**216.** 216. Then if they disobey you, say: "I am innocent of what you do."

**217.** 217. And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,

**218.** 218. Who sees you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) when you stand up (alone at night for Tahajjud prayers).

**219.** 219. And your movements among those who fall prostrate (to All�h in the five compulsory congregational prayers).

**220.** 220. Verily He, only He, is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.

**221.** 221. Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the Shay�t�n (devils) descend?

**222.** 222. They descend on every lying, sinful person.

**223.** 223. Who gives ear (to the devils and they pour what they may have heard of the Unseen from the angels), and most of them are liars.

**224.** 224. As for the poets, the erring ones follow them,

**225.** 225. See you not that they speak about every subject (praising people - right or wrong) in their poetry?

**226.** 226. And that they say what they do not do.

**227.** 227. Except those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do righteous deeds, and remember All�h much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged [by replying back in poetry to the unjust poetry (which the pagan poets utter against the Muslims)]. And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning they will be overturned.
