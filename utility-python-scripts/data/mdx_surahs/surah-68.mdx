# Surah 68: The Pen (Al-Qalam)

**1.** 1. N�n.
[These letters (Nun, etc.) are one of the miracles of the Qur�an, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings].
By the pen and by what they (the angels) write (in the Records of men).

**2.** 2. You (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), by the Grace of your Lord, are not mad.

**3.** 3. And Verily, for you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) will be an endless reward.

**4.** 4. And Verily, you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) are on an exalted (standard of) character.

**5.** 5. You will see, and they will see,

**6.** 6. Which of you is afflicted with madness.

**7.** 7. Verily, your Lord is the Best Knower of him who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Knower of those who are guided.

**8.** 8. So (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) obey you not the deniers [(of Isl�mic Monotheism - those who belie the Verses of All�h), the Oneness of All�h, and the Messengership of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????][1]

**9.** 9. They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them: so they (too) would compromise with you.

**10.** 10. And (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) obey you not everyone Hallaf Mah�n (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless). [Tafsir At-Tabari]

**11.** 11. A slanderer, going about with calumnies,

**12.** 12. Hinderer of the good, transgressor, sinful,

**13.** 13. Cruel, and moreover base-born (of illegitimate birth).

**14.** 14. (He was so) because he had wealth and children.

**15.** 15. When Our Verses (of the Qur��n) are recited to him, he says: "Tales of the men of old!"

**16.** 16. We shall brand him on the snout (nose)!

**17.** 17. Verily, We have tried them as We tried the people of the garden, when they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning,

**18.** 18. Without saying: Insh� All�h (If All�h wills).

**19.** 19. Then there passed by on the (garden) a visitation (fire) from your Lord at night and burnt it while they were asleep.

**20.** 20. So the (garden) became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (in complete ruins).

**21.** 21. Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke.

**22.** 22. Saying: "Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck the fruits."

**23.** 23. So they departed, conversing in secret low tones (saying):

**24.** 24. "No Misk�n (poor man) shall enter upon you into it today."

**25.** 25. And they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have power (to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom).

**26.** 26. But when they saw the (garden), they said: "Verily, we have gone astray."

**27.** 27. (Then they said): "Nay! Indeed we are deprived of (the fruits)!"

**28.** 28. The best among them said: "Did I not tell you: why say you not: Insh� All�h (If All�h wills)."

**29.** 29. They said: "Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been Z�lim�n (wrong-doers)."

**30.** 30. Then they turned one against another, blaming.

**31.** 31. They said: "Woe to us! Verily, we were T�gh�n (transgressors and disobedient)

**32.** 32. We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord (wishing for good that He may forgive our sins and reward us in the Hereafter).

**33.** 33. Such is the punishment (in this life), but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater if they but knew.

**34.** 34. Verily, for the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) are Gardens of delight (Paradise) with their Lord.

**35.** 35. Shall We then treat the Muslims (believers of Islamic Monotheism, doers of righteous deeds) like the Mujrim�n (criminals, polytheists and disbelievers, etc.)?

**36.** 36. What is the matter with you? How judge you?

**37.** 37. Or have you a Book wherein you learn,

**38.** 38. That you shall therein have all that you choose?

**39.** 39. Or have you oaths from Us, reaching to the Day of Resurrection, that yours will be what you judge?

**40.** 40. Ask them, which of them will stand surety for that!

**41.** 41. Or have they "partners"? Then let them bring their "partners" if they are truthful!

**42.** 42. (Remember) the Day when the Shin[1] shall be laid bare (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) and they shall be called to prostrate themselves (to All�h), but they (hypocrites) shall not be able to do so.

**43.** 43. Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them; they used to be called to prostrate themselves (offer prayers), while they were healthy and good (in the life of the world, but they did not).

**44.** 44. Then leave Me Alone with such as belie this Qur��n. We shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not.

**45.** 45. And I will grant them a respite. Verily, My Plan is strong.

**46.** 46. Or is it that you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) ask them a wage, so that they are heavily burdened with debt?

**47.** 47. Or that the Ghaib (the Unseen - here in this Verse it means Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z) is in their hands, so that they can write it down?

**48.** 48. So wait with patience for the Decision of your Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish - when he cried out (to Us) while he was in deep sorrow. (See the Qur��n, Verse 21:87).

**49.** 49. Had not a Grace from his Lord reached him, he would indeed have been (left in the stomach of the fish, but We forgave him): so he was cast off on the naked shore, while he was to be blamed.

**50.** 50. Then his Lord chose him and made him of the righteous.

**51.** 51. And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes (through hatred) when they hear the Reminder (the Qur��n), and they say: "Verily, he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is a madman!"

**52.** 52. But it is nothing else than a Reminder to all the ��lam�n (mankind, and jinn).
