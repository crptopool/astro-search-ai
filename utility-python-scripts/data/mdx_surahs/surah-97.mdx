# Surah 97: The Power (Al-Qadr)

**1.** 1. Verily, We have sent it (this Qur��n) down in the night of Al-Qadr (Decree).[1]

**2.** 2. And what will make you know what the night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is?

**3.** 3. The night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping All�h in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).

**4.** 4. Therein descend the angels and the R�h [Jibr�l (Gabr�l)] by All�h�s Permission with all Decrees,

**5.** 5. (All that night), there is Peace (and Goodness from All�h to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.[2]
