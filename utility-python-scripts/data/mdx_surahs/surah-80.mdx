# Surah 80: He Frowned (Abasa)

**1.** 1. (The Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????) frowned and turned away.

**2.** 2. Because there came to him the blind man (i.e. �Abdull�h bin Umm-Makt�m, who came to the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ???? while he was preaching to one or some of the Quraish chiefs).

**3.** 3. And how can you know that he might become pure (from sins)?

**4.** 4. Or he might receive admonition, and the admonition might profit him?

**5.** 5. As for him who thinks himself self-sufficient,

**6.** 6. To him you attend;

**7.** 7. What does it matter to you if he will not become pure (from disbelief: you are only a Messenger, your duty is to convey the Message of All�h).

**8.** 8. But as to him who came to you running,

**9.** 9. And is afraid (of All�h and His punishment).

**10.** 10. Of him you are neglectful and divert your attention to another,

**11.** 11. Nay, (do not do like this); indeed it (this Qur��n) is an admonition.

**12.** 12. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it.

**13.** 13. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honour (Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z),

**14.** 14. Exalted (in dignity), purified,

**15.** 15. In the hands of scribes (angels).

**16.** 16. Honourable and obedient.

**17.** 17. Be cursed (the disbelieving) man! How ungrateful he is!

**18.** 18. From what thing did He create him?

**19.** 19. From Nutfah (male and female semen drops) He created him and then set him in due proportion.

**20.** 20. Then He makes the Path easy for him.

**21.** 21. Then He causes him to die and puts him in his grave.

**22.** 22. Then when it is His Will, He will resurrect him (again).

**23.** 23. Nay, but (man) has not done what He commanded him.

**24.** 24. Then let man look at his food:

**25.** 25. We pour forth water in abundance.

**26.** 26. And We split the earth in clefts.

**27.** 27. And We cause therein the grain to grow,

**28.** 28. And grapes and clover plants (i.e. green fodder for the cattle),

**29.** 29. And olives and date-palms,

**30.** 30. And gardens dense with many trees,

**31.** 31. And fruits and herbage

**32.** 32. (To be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.

**33.** 33. Then when there comes As-S�khkhah (the second blowing of the Trumpet on the Day of Resurrection)

**34.** 34. That Day shall a man flee from his brother,

**35.** 35. And from his mother and his father,

**36.** 36. And from his wife and his children.

**37.** 37. Everyman that Day will have enough to make him careless of others.

**38.** 38. Some faces that Day will be bright (true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism),

**39.** 39. Laughing, rejoicing at good news (of Paradise).

**40.** 40. And other faces, that Day, will be dust-stained.

**41.** 41. Darkness will cover them.

**42.** 42. Such will be the Kafarah (disbelievers in All�h, in His Oneness, and in His Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, etc.), the Fajarah (wicked evil doers).
