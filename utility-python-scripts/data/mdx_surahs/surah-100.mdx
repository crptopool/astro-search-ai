# Surah 100: The Courser (Al-'Adiyat)

**1.** 1. By the (steeds) that run, with panting.

**2.** 2. Striking sparks of fire (by their hooves).

**3.** 3. And scouring to the raid at dawn.

**4.** 4. And raise the dust in clouds the while.

**5.** 5. And penetrating forthwith as one into the midst (of the foe).

**6.** 6. Verily, man (disbeliever) is ungrateful to his Lord.

**7.** 7. And to that he bears witness (by his deeds).

**8.** 8. And verily, he is violent in the love of wealth.

**9.** 9. Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth (all mankind is resurrected)?

**10.** 10. And that which is in the breasts (of men) is made known?

**11.** 11. Verily, that Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) their Lord will be Well-Acquainted with them (as to their deeds and will reward them for their deeds).
