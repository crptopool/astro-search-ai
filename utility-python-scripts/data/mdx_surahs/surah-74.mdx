# Surah 74: The Cloaked One (Al-Muddaththir)

**1.** 1. O you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) enveloped in garments!

**2.** 2. Arise and warn!

**3.** 3. And magnify your Lord (All�h)!

**4.** 4. And purify your garments!

**5.** 5. And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)!

**6.** 6. And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of obedience to All�h as a favour to Him).

**7.** 7. And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e. perform your duty to All�h)!

**8.** 8. Then, when the Trumpet is sounded (i.e. the second blowing of the horn).

**9.** 9. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -

**10.** 10. Far from easy for the disbelievers.

**11.** 11. Leave Me Alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely (without any wealth or children etc, i.e. Al-Wal�d bin Al-Mugh�rah Al-Makhz�m�)!

**12.** 12. And then granted him resources in abundance.

**13.** 13. And children to be by his side.

**14.** 14. And made life smooth and comfortable for him.

**15.** 15. After all that he desires that I should give more;

**16.** 16. Nay! Verily, he has been opposing Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations).

**17.** 17. I shall oblige him to (climb a slippery mountain in the Hell-fire called As-Sa��d, or) face a severe torment!

**18.** 18. Verily, he thought and plotted.

**19.** 19. So let him be cursed: how he plotted!

**20.** 20. And once more let him be cursed: how he plotted!

**21.** 21. Then he thought.

**22.** 22. Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way;

**23.** 23. Then he turned back, and was proud.

**24.** 24. Then he said: "This is nothing but magic from that of old,

**25.** 25. "This is nothing but the word of a human being!"

**26.** 26. I will cast him into Hell-fire.[1]

**27.** 27. And what will make you know (exactly) what Hell-fire is?

**28.** 28. It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)!

**29.** 29. Burning and blackening the skins!

**30.** 30. Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell).

**31.** 31. And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire. And We have fixed their number (19) only as a trial for the disbelievers, in order that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may arrive at a certainty [that this Qur��n is the truth as it agrees with their Books regarding the number (19) which is written in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and that the believers may increase in Faith (as this Qur��n is the truth), and that no doubt may be left for the people of the Scripture and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the disbelievers may say: "What All�h intends by this (curious) example ?" Thus All�h leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He. And this (Hell) is nothing else than a (warning) reminder to mankind.

**32.** 32. Nay! And by the moon

**33.** 33. And by the night when it withdraws.

**34.** 34. And by the dawn when it brightens.

**35.** 35. Verily, it (Hell, or their denial of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, or the Day of Resurrection) is but one of the greatest (signs).

**36.** 36. A warning to mankind -

**37.** 37. To any of you that chooses to go forward (by working righteous deeds), or to remain behind (by committing sins).

**38.** 38. Every person is a pledge for what he has earned,

**39.** 39. Except those on the Right, (i.e. the pious true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism).

**40.** 40. In Gardens (Paradise) they will ask one another,

**41.** 41. About Al-Mujrim�n (polytheists, criminals, disbelievers), (And they will say to them):

**42.** 42. "What has caused you to enter Hell?"

**43.** 43. They will say: "We were not of those who used to offer the Sal�t (prayers),[2]

**44.** 44. "Nor we used to feed Al-Misk�n (the poor);

**45.** 45. "And we used to talk falsehood (all that which All�h hated) with vain talkers.[3]

**46.** 46. And we used to belie the Day of Recompense,[4]

**47.** 47. "Until there came to us (the death) that is certain."

**48.** 48. So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them.

**49.** 49. Then what is wrong with them (i.e. the polytheists, the disbelievers) that they turn away from (receiving) admonition?

**50.** 50. As if they were (frightened) wild donkeys.

**51.** 51. Fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, or a beast of prey.

**52.** 52. Nay, everyone of them desires that he should be given pages spread out (coming from All�h with a writing that Isl�m is the right religion, and Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? has come with the truth from All�h, the Lord of the heavens and earth).

**53.** 53. Nay! But they fear not the Hereafter (from All�h�s punishment).

**54.** 54. Nay, verily, this (Qur�an) is an admonition,

**55.** 55. So whosoever will (let him read it), and receive admonition (from it)!

**56.** 56. And they will not receive admonition unless All�h wills; He (All�h) is the One, deserving that mankind should be afraid of, and should be dutiful to Him, and should not take any Il�h (god) along with Him, and He is the One Who forgives (sins).
