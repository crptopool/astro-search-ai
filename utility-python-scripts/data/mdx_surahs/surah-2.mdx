# Surah 2: The Cow (Al-Baqarah)

**1.** 1. Alif-L�m-M�m. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur��n and none but All�h (Alone) knows their meanings.]

**2.** 2. This is the Book (the Qur��n), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaq�n [the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear All�h much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love All�h much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].

**3.** 3. Who believe in the Ghaib [1] and perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t),[2] and spend out of what We have provided for them [i.e. give Zak�t [3], spend on themselves, their parents, their children, their wives, etc., and also give charity to the poor and also in All�h�s Cause - Jih�d].

**4.** 4. And who believe in (the Qur��n and the Sunnah )[4] which has been sent down (revealed) to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and in that which was sent down before you [the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.] and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter. (Resurrection, recompense of their good and bad deeds, Paradise and Hell).

**5.** 5. They are on (true) guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.

**6.** 6. Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them whether you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.

**7.** 7. All�h has set a seal on their hearts and on their hearing, (i.e. they are closed from accepting All�h�s Guidance), and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be a great torment.

**8.** 8. And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: "We believe in All�h and the Last Day" while in fact they believe not.

**9.** 9. They (think to) deceive All�h and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!

**10.** 10. In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and All�h has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.

**11.** 11. And when it is said to them: "Make not mischief on the earth," they say: "We are only peace-makers."

**12.** 12. Verily! They are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not.

**13.** 13. And when it is said to them (hypocrites): "Believe as the people (followers of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, Al-Ans�r and Al-Muhajir�n) have believed," they say: "Shall we believe as the fools have believed?" Verily, they are the fools, but they know not.

**14.** 14. And when they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe," but when they are alone with their Shay�t�n (devils - polytheists, hypocrites), they say: "Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking."

**15.** 15. All�h mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly.

**16.** 16. These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce was profitless. And they were not guided.

**17.** 17. Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, All�h took away their light and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see.

**18.** 18. They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the Right Path).

**19.** 19. Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunder-clap for fear of death. But All�h ever encompasses the disbelievers (i.e. All�h will gather them all together).

**20.** 20. The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if All�h willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, All�h has power over all things.

**21.** 21. O mankind! Worship your Lord (All�h), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**22.** 22. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto All�h (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).[1]

**23.** 23. And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur��n) to Our slave (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), then produce a S�rah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides All�h, if you are truthful.

**24.** 24. But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.

**25.** 25. And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise). Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: "This is what we were provided with before," and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e. in the same form but different in taste) and they shall have therein Azw�jun Mutahharatun [1] (purified mates or wives) and they will abide therein forever.

**26.** 26. Verily, All�h is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: "What did All�h intend by this parable?" By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-F�siq�n (the rebellious, disobedient to All�h[2]).

**27.** 27. Those who break All�h�s Covenant after ratifying it, and sever what All�h has ordered to be joined (as regards All�h�s religion of Isl�mic Monotheism, and to practise its laws on the earth and also as regards keeping good relations with kith and kin[3]), and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.

**28.** 28. How can you disbelieve in All�h? seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return (See V.40:11)

**29.** 29. He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He rose over (Istaw�) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything.

**30.** 30. And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth." They said: "Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while we glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You." He (All�h) said: "I know that which you do not know."

**31.** 31. And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)[1], then He showed them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful."

**32.** 32. They (angels) said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise."

**33.** 33. He said: "O Adam! Inform them of their names," and when he had informed them of their names, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (Unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?"

**34.** 34. And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam.". And they prostrated except Ibl�s (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to All�h).

**35.** 35. And We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Z�lim�n (wrong-doers)."

**36.** 36. Then the Shait�n (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: "Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time."

**37.** 37. Then Adam received from his Lord Words.[2] And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful.

**38.** 38. We said: "Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.

**39.** 39. But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) - such are the dwellers of the Fire. They shall abide therein forever.

**40.** 40. O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil (your obligations to) My Covenant (with you) so that I fulfil (My Obligations to) your covenant (with Me), and fear none but Me.

**41.** 41. And believe in what I have sent down (this Qur��n), confirming that which is with you, [the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], and be not the first to disbelieve therein, and buy [get (???? ????)] not with My Verses [the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] a small price (i.e. getting a small gain by selling My Verses), and fear Me and Me Alone. (Tafs�r At-Tabar� ).

**42.** 42. And mix not truth with falsehood, nor conceal the truth [i.e. Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? is All�h�s Messenger and his qualities are written in your Scriptures, the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] while you know (the truth).[1]

**43.** 43. And perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to All�h) along with Ar-Raki��n[2].

**44.** 44. Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to All�h) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves,[3] while you recite the Scripture [the Taur�t (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?

**45.** 45. And seek help in patience and As-Sal�t (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Kh�shi��n [i.e. the true believers in All�h - those who obey All�h with full submission, fear much from His Punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)].

**46.** 46. (They are those) who are certain that they are going to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are going to return.

**47.** 47. O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the ��lam�n [mankind and jinn (of your time period, in the past)].

**48.** 48. And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped.

**49.** 49. And (remember) when We delivered you from Fir�aun�s (Pharaoh) people, who were afflicting you with a horrible torment, killing your sons and sparing your women, and therein was a mighty trial from your Lord.

**50.** 50. And (remember) when We separated the sea for you and saved you and drowned Fir�aun�s (Pharaoh) people while you were looking (at them, when the sea-water covered them).

**51.** 51. And (remember) when We appointed for M�s� (Moses) forty nights, and (in his absence) you took the calf (for worship), and you were Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**52.** 52. Then after that We forgave you so that you might be grateful.

**53.** 53. And (remember) when We gave M�s� (Moses) the Scripture [the Taur�t (Torah)] and the criterion (of right and wrong) so that you may be guided aright."

**54.** 54. And (remember) when M�s� (Moses) said to his people: "O my people! Verily, you have wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf. So turn in repentance to your Creator and kill yourselves (the innocent kill the wrongdoers among you), that will be better for you with your Creator." Then He accepted your repentance. Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.

**55.** 55. And (remember) when you said: "O M�s� (Moses)! We shall never believe in you until we see All�h plainly." But you were seized with a thunder-bolt (lightning) while you were looking.

**56.** 56. Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.

**57.** 57. And We shaded you with clouds and sent down on you Al-Manna [1] and the quails, (saying): "Eat of the good lawful things We have provided for you," (but they rebelled). And they did not wrong Us but they wronged themselves.

**58.** 58. And (remember) when We said: "Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat bountifully therein with pleasure and delight wherever you wish, and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with humility) and say: �Forgive us,� and We shall forgive you your sins and shall increase (reward) for the good-doers."

**59.** 59. But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijz (a punishment)[1] from the heaven because of their rebelling against All�h�s obedience. (Tafsir At-Tabar�).

**60.** 60. And (remember) when M�s� (Moses) asked for water for his people, We said: "Strike the stone with your stick." Then gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each (group of) people knew its own place for water. "Eat and drink of that which All�h has provided and do not act corruptly, making mischief on the earth."

**61.** 61. And (remember) when you said, "O M�s� (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its F�m (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions." He said, "Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!" And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of All�h. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of All�h and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to All�h, i.e. commit crimes and sins).

**62.** 62. Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians,[1] whoever believes in All�h and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.[2]

**63.** 63. And (O Children of Israel, remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): "Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**64.** 64. Then after that you turned away. Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of All�h upon you, indeed you would have been among the losers.

**65.** 65. And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: "Be you monkeys, despised and rejected."

**66.** 66. So We made this punishment an example to their own and to succeeding generations and a lesson to those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**67.** 67. And (remember) when M�s� (Moses) said to his people: "Verily, All�h commands you that you slaughter a cow." They said, "Do you make fun of us?" He said, "I take All�h�s Refuge from being among Al-J�hil�n (the ignorant or the foolish)."

**68.** 68. They said, "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!" He said, "He says, �Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions�, so do what you are commanded."

**69.** 69. They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its colour." He said, "He says, �It is a yellow cow, bright in its colour, pleasing to the beholders.� "

**70.** 70. They said, "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. Verily, to us all cows are alike. And surely, if All�h wills, we will be guided."

**71.** 71. He [M�s� (Moses)] said, "He says, �It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no other colour except bright yellow.� " They said, "Now you have brought the truth." So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it.

**72.** 72. And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But All�h brought forth that which you were hiding.

**73.** 73. So We said: "Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow)." Thus All�h brings the dead to life and shows you His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) so that you may understand.

**74.** 74. Then, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness. And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of All�h. And All�h is not unaware of what you do.

**75.** 75. Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of All�h [the Taur�t (Torah)], then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?

**76.** 76. And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say, "We believe", but when they meet one another in private, they say, "Shall you (Jews) tell them (Muslims) what All�h has revealed to you [Jews, about the description and the qualities of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, that which are written in the Taur�t (Torah)][1], that they (Muslims) may argue with you (Jews) about it before your Lord?" Have you (Jews) then no understanding?

**77.** 77. Know they (Jews) not that All�h knows what they conceal and what they reveal?

**78.** 78. And there are among them (Jews) unlettered people, who know not the Book, but they trust upon false desires and they but guess.

**79.** 79. Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, "This is from All�h," to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.

**80.** 80. And they (Jews) say, "The Fire (i.e. Hell-fire on the Day of Resurrection) shall not touch us but for a few numbered days." Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? to them): "Have you taken a covenant from All�h, so that All�h will not break His Covenant? Or is it that you say of All�h what you know not?"

**81.** 81. Yes! Whosoever earns evil and his sin has surrounded him, they are dwellers of the Fire (i.e. Hell); they will dwell therein forever.

**82.** 82. And those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h ????? - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever. (See V. 2:257)

**83.** 83. And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but All�h (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and Al-Mas�k�n [1] (the poor), and speak good to people [i.e. enjoin righteousness and forbid evil, and say the truth about Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????], and perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t. Then you slid back, except a few of you, while you are backsliders. (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�).

**84.** 84. And (remember) when We took your covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your (people), nor turn out your own people from their dwellings. Then, (this) you ratified and (to this) you bear witness.

**85.** 85. After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then do you believe in a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the recompense of those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous torment. And All�h is not unaware of what you do.

**86.** 86. Those are they who have bought the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.

**87.** 87. And indeed, We gave M�s� (Moses) the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave ��s� (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with R�h-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel ???? ??????)]. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some you disbelieved and some you killed.

**88.** 88. And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped (i.e. do not hear or understand All�h�s Word)." Nay, All�h has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is that which they believe.

**89.** 89. And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur��n) from All�h confirming what is with them [the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked All�h (for coming of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the Curse of All�h be on the disbelievers.

**90.** 90. How bad is that for which they have sold their ownselves, that they should disbelieve in that which All�h has revealed (the Qur��n), grudging that All�h should reveal of His Grace unto whom He wills of His slaves. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment.

**91.** 91. And when it is said to them (the Jews), "Believe in what All�h has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? to them): "Why then have you killed the Prophets of All�h aforetime, if you indeed have been believers?"

**92.** 92. And indeed M�s� (Moses) came to you with clear proofs, yet you worshipped the calf after he left, and you were Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrongdoers).

**93.** 93. And (remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying), "Hold firmly to what We have given you and hear (Our Word)." They said, "We have heard and disobeyed." And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: "Worst indeed is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are believers."

**94.** 94. Say to (them): "If the home of the Hereafter with All�h is indeed for you specially and not for others, of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful."

**95.** 95. But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e. what they have done). And All�h is All-Aware of the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**96.** 96. And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to All�h (and do not believe in Resurrection - Maj�s, pagans, and idolaters). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years. But the grant of such life will not save him even a little from (due) punishment. And All�h is All-Seer of what they do.

**97.** 97. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Whoever is an enemy to Jibr�l (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur��n) down to your heart by All�h�s Permission, confirming what came before it [i.e. the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and guidance and glad tidings for the believers.

**98.** 98. Whoever is an enemy to All�h, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibr�l (Gabriel) and M�k��l (Michael), then verily, All�h is an enemy to the disbelievers."

**99.** 99. And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ay�t (these Verses of the Qur��n which inform in detail about the news of the Jews and their secret intentions, etc.), and none disbelieve in them but F�siq�n (those who rebel against All�h�s Command).

**100.** 100. Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside? Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe not.

**101.** 101. And when there came to them a Messenger from All�h (i.e. Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of All�h behind their backs as if they did not know!

**102.** 102. They followed what the Shay�t�n (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulaim�n (Solomon). Sulaim�n did not disbelieve, but the Shay�t�n (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, H�r�t and M�r�t, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, "We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us)." And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by All�h�s Leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their ownselves, if they but knew.

**103.** 103. And if they had believed, and guarded themselves from evil and kept their duty to All�h, far better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!

**104.** 104. O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger ??? ???? ???? ????) R�ina [1] but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment. (See Verse 4:46)

**105.** 105. Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrik�n (the idolaters, polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h, pagans, etc.) like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord. But All�h chooses for His Mercy whom He wills. And All�h is the Owner of Great Bounty.

**106.** 106. Whatever a Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that All�h is able to do all things?

**107.** 107. Know you not that it is All�h to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides All�h you have neither any Wal� (protector or guardian) nor any helper.

**108.** 108. Or do you want to ask your Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as M�s� (Moses) was asked before (i.e. show us openly our Lord)? And he who changes Faith for disbelief, verily, he has gone astray from the Right Way.

**109.** 109. Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? is All�h�s Messenger) has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till All�h brings His Command.[1] Verily, All�h is Able to do all things.

**110.** 110. And perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t and whatever of good (deeds that All�h loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with All�h. Certainly, All�h is All-Seer of what you do.

**111.** 111. And they say, "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), "Produce your proof if you are truthful."

**112.** 112. Yes, but whoever submits his face (himself) to All�h (i.e. follows All�h�s Religion of Isl�mic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin [2] then his reward is with his Lord (All�h), on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. [See Tafsir Ibn Kath�r ].

**113.** 113. The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. All�h will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they have been differing.

**114.** 114. And who are more unjust than those who forbid that All�h�s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in All�h�s Mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (All�h�s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.

**115.** 115. And to All�h belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of All�h (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knowing.

**116.** 116. And they (Jews, Christians and pagans) say: All�h has begotten a son (children or offspring)[1]. Glory be to Him (Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him). Nay, to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, and all surrender with obedience (in worship) to Him.

**117.** 117. The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it: "Be!" - and it is.

**118.** 118. And those who have no knowledge say: "Why does not All�h speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us?" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.

**119.** 119. Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with the truth (Isl�m), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, that they will enter the Hell-fire).[2] And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.

**120.** 120. Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) till you follow their religion. Say: "Verily, the Guidance of All�h (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Qur��n), then you would have against All�h neither any Wal� (protector or guardian) nor any helper.

**121.** 121. Those (who embraced Isl�m from Ban� Israel) to whom We gave the Book [the Taur�t (Torah)] [or those (Muhammad�s ??? ???? ???? ???? companions) to whom We have given the Book (the Qur��n)] recite it (i.e. obey its orders and follow its teachings) as it should be recited (i.e. followed), they are the ones who believe therein. And whoso disbelieve in it (the Qur��n), those are they who are the losers. (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�).

**122.** 122. O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the ��lam�n [mankind and jinn (of your time-period, in the past)].

**123.** 123. And fear the Day (of Judgement) when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped.

**124.** 124. And (remember) when the Lord of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) [i.e., All�h] tried him with (certain) Commands,[1] which he fulfilled. He (All�h) said (to him), "Verily, I am going to make you an Im�m (a leader) for mankind (to follow you)." [Ibr�h�m (Abraham)] said, "And of my offspring (to make leaders)." (All�h) said, "My Covenant (Prophethood) includes not Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers)."

**125.** 125. And (remember) when We made the House (the Ka�bah at Makkah) a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maq�m (place) of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibr�h�m (Abraham) ???? ?????? stood while he was building the Ka�bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak�at after the Taw�f of the Ka�bahat Makkah), and We commanded Ibr�h�m (Abraham) and Ism��l (Ishmael) that they should purify My House (the Ka�bah at Makkah) for those who are circumambulating it, or staying (I�tik�f), or bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer).

**126.** 126. And (remember) when Ibr�h�m (Abraham) said, "My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in All�h and the Last Day." He (All�h) answered: "As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!"

**127.** 127. And (remember) when Ibr�h�m (Abraham) and (his son) Ism��l (Ishmael) were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka�bah at Makkah), (saying), "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower." [1]

**128.** 128. Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our Man�sik [2] (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage - Hajjand �Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.

**129.** 129. Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own (and indeed All�h answered their invocation by sending Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur��n) and Al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Isl�mic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood), and purify them. Verily! You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise."

**130.** 130. And who turns away from the religion of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism) except him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous.

**131.** 131. When his Lord said to him, "Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!" He said, "I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists)."

**132.** 132. And this (submission to All�h, Isl�m) was enjoined by Ibr�h�m (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya�q�b (Jacob) (saying), "O my sons! All�h has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Isl�m (as Muslims - Isl�mic Monotheism)."

**133.** 133. Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya�q�b (Jacob)? When he said unto his sons, "What will you worship after me?" They said, "We shall worship your Il�h (God - All�h), the Il�h (God) of your fathers, Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ism��l (Ishmael), Ish�q (Isaac), One Il�h (God), and to Him we submit (in Isl�m)."

**134.** 134. That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn. And you will not be asked of what they used to do.

**135.** 135. And they say, "Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided." Say (to them O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), "Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Han�fa [Isl�mic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but All�h (Alone)], and he was not of Al-Mushrik�n (those who worshipped others along with All�h - see V.2:105)."[1]

**136.** 136. Say (O Muslims), "We believe in All�h and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ism��l (Ishmael), Ish�q (Isaac), Ya�q�b (Jacob), and to Al-Asb�t [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya�q�b (Jacob)], and that which has been given to M�s� (Moses) and ��s� (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Isl�m)."

**137.** 137. So if they believe in the like of that which you believe, then they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. So All�h will suffice you against them. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.

**138.** 138. [Our Sibghah (religion) is] the Sibghah (Religion) of All�h (Isl�m) and which Sibghah (religion) can be better than All�h�s? And we are His worshippers. [Tafsir Ibn Kath�r]

**139.** 139. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? to the Jews and Christians), "Dispute you with us about All�h while He is our Lord and your Lord? And we are to be rewarded for our deeds and you for your deeds.[2] And we are sincere to Him [in worship and obedience (i.e. we worship Him Alone and none else, and we obey His Orders)]."

**140.** 140. Or say you that Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ism��l (Ishmael), Ish�q (Isaac), Ya�q�b (Jacob) and Al-Asb�t [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya�q�b (Jacob)] were Jews or Christians? Say, "Do you know better or does All�h (knows better ... that they all were Muslims)? And who is more unjust than he who conceals the testimony [i.e. to believe in Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? when he comes, as is written in their Books. (See Verse 7:157)] he has from All�h? And All�h is not unaware of what you do."

**141.** 141. That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned, and you of what you earn. And you will not be asked of what they used to do.

**142.** 142. The fools among the people (pagans, hypocrites, and Jews) will say, "What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah [prayer direction (towards Jerusalem)] to which they used to face in prayer." Say, (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) "To All�h belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the Straight Way."

**143.** 143. Thus We have made you [true Muslims - real believers of Isl�mic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankind[1] and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) be a witness over you. And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom All�h guided. And All�h would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered towards Jerusalem). Truly, All�h is full of Kindness, the Most Merciful towards mankind.

**144.** 144. Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad�s ??? ???? ???? ????) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-al-Har�m (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka�bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And All�h is not unaware of what they do.

**145.** 145. And even if you were to bring to the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah (prayer direction). And they will not follow each other�s Qiblah (prayer direction). Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from All�h), then indeed you will be one of the Z�lim�n (polytheists, wrong-doers).

**146.** 146. Those to whom We gave the Scripture (Jews and Christians) recognise him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? or the Ka�bah at Makkah) as they recognise their sons. But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it - [i.e. the qualities of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? which are written in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)].[1]

**147.** 147. (This is) the truth from your Lord. So be you not one of those who doubt.

**148.** 148. For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in their prayers). So hasten towards all that is good. Wheresoever you may be, All�h will bring you together (on the Day of Resurrection). Truly, All�h is Able to do all things.

**149.** 149. And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-Al-Har�m (at Makkah), that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And All�h is not unaware of what you do.

**150.** 150. And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid-Al-Har�m (at Makkah), and wheresoever you are, turn your faces towards it (when you pray) so that men may have no argument against you except those of them that are wrong-doers, so fear them not, but fear Me! - And so that I may complete My Blessings on you and that you may be guided.

**151.** 151. Similarly (to complete My Blessings on you), We have sent among you a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) of your own, reciting to you Our Verses (the Qur��n) and purifying you, and teaching you the Book (the Qur��n) and the Hikmah (i.e. Sunnah, Isl�mic laws and Fiqh - jurisprudence), and teaching you that which you used not to know.

**152.** 152. Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying),[2] I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me.

**153.** 153. O you who believe! Seek help in patience and As-Sal�t (the prayer). Truly! All�h is with As-S�bir�n (the patient).

**154.** 154. And say not of those who are killed in the Way of All�h, "They are dead." Nay, they are living, but you perceive (it) not.

**155.** 155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-S�bir�n (the patient).

**156.** 156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "Truly! To All�h we belong and truly, to Him we shall return."

**157.** 157. They are those on whom are the Salaw�t (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.

**158.** 158. Verily! As-Saf� and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of All�h. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or �Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House (the Ka�bah at Makkah) to perform the going (Taw�f) between them (As-Saf� and Al-Marwah).[1] And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, All�h is All-Recogniser, All-Knower.

**159.** 159. Verily, those who conceal the clear proofs, evidence and the guidance, which We have sent down, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by All�h and cursed by the cursers.

**160.** 160. Except those who repent and do righteous deeds, and openly declare (the truth which they concealed). These, I will accept their repentance. And I am the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.

**161.** 161. Verily, those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers, it is they on whom is the Curse of All�h and of the angels and of mankind, combined.

**162.** 162. They will abide therein (under the curse in Hell), their punishment will neither be lightened, nor will they be reprieved.

**163.** 163. And your Il�h (God) is One Il�h (God - All�h), L� il�ha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

**164.** 164. Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water (rain) which All�h sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed Ay�t (proofs, evidence, signs, etc.) for people of understanding.

**165.** 165. And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides All�h as rivals[1] (to All�h). They love them as they love All�h. But those who believe, love All�h more (than anything else). If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to All�h and that All�h is Severe in punishment.

**166.** 166. When those who were followed, disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.

**167.** 167. And those who followed will say: "If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves as innocent from) them as they have disowned (declared themselves as innocent from) us." Thus All�h will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.

**168.** 168. O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.

**169.** 169. He [Shait�n (Satan)] commands you only what is evil and Fahsh� (sinful), and that you should say against All�h what you know not.

**170.** 170. When it is said to them: "Follow what All�h has sent down." They say: "Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following." (Would they do that!) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided?

**171.** 171. And the example of those who disbelieve is as that of him who shouts to those (flock of sheep) that hears nothing but calls and cries. (They are) deaf, dumb and blind. So they do not understand. (Tafs�r Al-Qurtubi )

**172.** 172. O you who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you[1] with, and be grateful to All�h, if it is indeed He Whom you worship.

**173.** 173. He has forbidden you only the Maitah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than All�h (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which All�h�s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**174.** 174. Verily, those who conceal what All�h has sent down of the Book, and purchase a small gain therewith (of worldly things), they eat into their bellies nothing but fire. All�h will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment.

**175.** 175. Those are they who have purchased error at the price of Guidance, and torment at the price of Forgiveness. So how bold they are (for evil deeds which will push them) to the Fire.

**176.** 176. That is because All�h has sent down the Book (the Qur��n) in truth. And verily, those who disputed as regards the Book are far away in opposition.

**177.** 177. It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to All�h, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in All�h, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets[1] and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Mas�k�n (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t ), and gives the Zak�t, and who fulfil their covenant when they make it, and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**178.** 178. O you who believe! Al-Qis�s (the Law of Equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives, etc.) of the killed against blood-money, then adhering to it with fairness and payment of the blood-money to the heir should be made in fairness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. So after this whoever transgresses the limits (i.e. kills the killer after taking the blood-money), he shall have a painful torment.

**179.** 179. And there is (a saving of) life for you in Al-Qis�s (the Law of Equality in punishment), O men of understanding, that you may become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2: 2).

**180.** 180. It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable manners. (This is) a duty upon Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2: 2).

**181.** 181. Then whoever changes the bequest after hearing it, the sin shall be on those who make the change. Truly, All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**182.** 182. But he who fears from a testator some unjust act or wrong-doing, and thereupon he makes peace between the parties concerned, there shall be no sin on him. Certainly, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**183.** 183. O you who believe! Observing As-Saum (the fasting)[1] is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2: 2).

**184.** 184. [Observing Saum (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Misk�n (poor person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know.[2]

**185.** 185. The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur��n, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Saum (fasts) must be made up] from other days. All�h intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify All�h [i.e. to say Takb�r (All�hu Akbar; All�h is the Most Great] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.[3]

**186.** 186. And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.[4]

**187.** 187. It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are Lib�s [i.e. body cover, or screen, or Sakan, (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them - as in Verse 7:189) Tafsir At-Tabar� ], for you and you are the same for them. All�h knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which All�h has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I�tik�f (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by All�h, so approach them not. Thus does All�h make clear His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, All�h�s set limits, orders) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**188.** 188. And eat up not one another�s property unjustly (in any illegal way e.g. stealing, robbing, deceiving, etc.), nor give bribery to the rulers (judges before presenting your cases) that you may knowingly eat up a part of the property of others sinfully.

**189.** 189. They ask you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you enter the houses from the back but Al-Birr (is the quality of the one) who fears All�h. So enter houses through their proper doors, and fear All�h that you may be successful.

**190.** 190. And fight in the Way of All�h[1] those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, All�h likes not the transgressors. [This Verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with Jih�d, but it was supplemented by another (9:36)].

**191.** 191. And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [1] is worse than killing. And fight not with them at Al-Masjid-Al-Har�m (the sanctuary at Makkah),[2] unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

**192.** 192. But if they cease, then All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**193.** 193. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with All�h) and (all and every kind of) worship is for All�h (Alone).[3] But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Z�lim�n (the polytheists, and wrong-doers)

**194.** 194. The sacred month is for the sacred month, and for the prohibited things, there is the Law of Equality (Qis�s). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him. And fear All�h, and know that All�h is with Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**195.** 195. And spend in the Cause of All�h (i.e. Jih�d of all kinds) and do not throw yourselves into destruction (by not spending your wealth in the Cause of All�h), and do good. Truly, All�h loves Al-Muhsin�n [4] (the good-doers).

**196.** 196. And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), the Hajj and �Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for All�h. But if you are prevented (from completing them), sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e. a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford, and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity - feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep). Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the �Umrah in the months of Hajj before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu� and Al-Qir�n), he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observe Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home), making ten days in all. This is for him whose family is not present at Al-Masjid-Al-Har�m (i.e. non-resident of Makkah). And fear All�h much and know that All�h is Severe in punishment.[5]

**197.** 197. The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Isl�mic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj[1] therein (by assuming Ihr�m), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) All�h knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!

**198.** 198. There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading). Then when you leave �Araf�t[2], remember All�h (by glorifying His Praises, i.e. prayers and invocations) at the Mash�ar-il-Har�m [3]. And remember Him (by invoking All�h for all good.) as He has guided you, and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray.

**199.** 199. Then depart from the place whence all the people depart and ask All�h for His Forgiveness. Truly, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.

**200.** 200. So when you have accomplished your Man�sik[4], remember All�h as you remember your forefathers or with a far more remembrance. But of mankind there are some who say: "Our Lord! Give us (Your Bounties) in this world!" and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter.

**201.** 201. And of them there are some who say: "Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!"

**202.** 202. For them there will be allotted a share for what they have earned. And All�h is Swift at reckoning.

**203.** 203. And remember All�h during the appointed Days.[1] But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good and obey All�h (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.

**204.** 204. And of mankind there is he whose speech may please you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), in this worldly life, and he calls All�h to witness as to that which is in his heart, yet he is the most quarrelsome of the opponents. [2]

**205.** 205. And when he turns away (from you "O Muhammad "??? ???? ???? ????"), his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle, and All�h likes not mischief.

**206.** 206. And when it is said to him, "Fear All�h", he is led by arrogance to (more) crime. So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest!

**207.** 207. And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the Pleasure of All�h. And All�h is full of Kindness to (His) slaves.

**208.** 208. O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Isl�m (by obeying all the rules and regulations of the Isl�mic religion) and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Verily! He is to you a plain enemy.

**209.** 209. Then if you slide back after the clear signs (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and this Qur��n, and Isl�m) have come to you, then know that All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

**210.** 210. Do they then wait for anything other than that All�h should come to them in the shadows of the clouds and the angels? (Then) the case would be already judged. And to All�h return all matters (for decision).

**211.** 211. Ask the Children of Israel how many clear Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) We gave them. And whoever changes All�h�s Favour after it had come to him, [e.g. renounces the Religion of All�h (Isl�m) and accepts Kufr (disbelief)] then surely, All�h is Severe in punishment.

**212.** 212. Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they mock at those who believe. But those who obey All�h�s Orders and keep away from what He has forbidden, will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And All�h gives (of His Bounty, Blessings, Favours, Honours on the Day of Resurrection) to whom He wills without limit.

**213.** 213. Mankind were one community and All�h sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed. And only those to whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it after clear proofs had come unto them through hatred, one to another. Then All�h by His Leave guided those who believed to the truth of that wherein they differed. And All�h guides whom He wills to the Straight Path.

**214.** 214. Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, "When (will come) the Help of All�h?" Yes! Certainly, the Help of All�h is near!

**215.** 215. They ask you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) what they should spend. Say: Whatever you spend of good must be for parents and kindred and orphans and Al-Mas�k�n (the poor) and the wayfarer, and whatever you do of good deeds, truly, All�h knows it well.

**216.** 216. Jih�d [1] (holy fighting in All�h�s cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. All�h knows but you do not know.

**217.** 217. They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Isl�mic calendar). Say "Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression)[2] with All�h is to prevent mankind from following the Way of All�h, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid-Al-Har�m (at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah[3] is worse than killing. And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Isl�mic Monotheism) if they can. And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever."

**218.** 218. Verily, those who have believed, and those who have emigrated (for All�h�s Religion) and have striven hard in the Way of All�h, all these hope for All�h�s Mercy. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.

**219.** 219. They ask you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling.[4] Say: "In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit." And they ask you what they ought to spend. Say: "That which is beyond your needs." Thus All�h makes clear to you His Laws in order that you may give thought." [5]

**220.** 220. In (to) this worldly life and in the Hereafter. And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: "The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. And All�h knows him who means mischief (e.g. to swallow their property) from him who means good (e.g. to save their property). And if All�h had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. Truly, All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise."

**221.** 221. And do not marry Al-Mushrik�t (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship All�h Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrik�n[1] till they believe (in All�h Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrik�n) invite you to the Fire, but All�h invites (you) to Paradise and Forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember.

**222.** 222. They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as All�h has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, All�h loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers).

**223.** 223. Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth,[2] when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask All�h to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand. And fear All�h, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)

**224.** 224. And make not All�h�s (Name) an excuse in your oaths against your doing good and acting piously, and making peace among mankind. And All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower (i.e. do not swear much and if you have sworn against doing something good then give an expiation for the oath and do good).[3]

**225.** 225. All�h will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Forbearing.

**226.** 226. Those who take an oath[1] not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**227.** 227. And if they decide upon divorce, then All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**228.** 228. And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods, and it is not lawful for them to conceal what All�h has created in their wombs, if they believe in All�h and the Last Day. And their husbands have the better right to take them back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation. And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

**229.** 229. The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by All�h (e.g. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by All�h, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul� (divorce)[2]. These are the limits ordained by All�h, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by All�h, then such are the Z�lim�n (wrong-doers).

**230.** 230. And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by All�h. These are the limits of All�h, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge.

**231.** 231. And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the Verses (Laws) of All�h as a jest, but remember All�h�s Favours on you (i.e. Isl�m), and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e. the Qur��n) and Al-Hikmah (the Prophet�s Sunnah - legal ways - Isl�mic jurisprudence.) whereby He instructs you. And fear All�h, and know that All�h is All-Aware of everything.

**232.** 232. And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually agree on reasonable basis. This (instruction) is an admonition for him among you who believes in All�h and the Last Day. That is more virtuous and purer for you. All�h knows and you know not.

**233.** 233. The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother�s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (father�s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them. And if you decide on a foster suckling-mother for your children, there is no sin on you, provided you pay (the mother) what you agreed (to give her) on reasonable basis. And fear All�h and know that All�h is All-Seer of what you do.

**234.** 234. And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days, then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no sin on you if they (the wives) dispose of themselves in a just and honourable manner (i.e. they can marry). And All�h is Well-Acquainted with what you do.

**235.** 235. And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal or conceal it in yourself, All�h knows that you will remember them, but do not make a promise of contract with them in secret except that you speak an honourable saying according to the Isl�mic law.[1] And do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is fulfilled. And know that All�h knows what is in your minds, so fear Him. And know that All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

**236.** 236. There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage). But bestow on them (a suitable gift), the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means, a gift of reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of good.

**237.** 237. And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr), unless they (the women) agree to forego it, or he (the husband), in whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to forego and give her full appointed Mahr. And to forego and give (her the full Mahr) is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). And do not forget liberality between yourselves. Truly, All�h is All-Seer of what you do.

**238.** 238. Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salaw�t (the prayers) especially the middle Sal�t (i.e. the best prayer - �Asr )[1]. And stand before All�h with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Sal�t (prayers)].

**239.** 239. And if you fear (an enemy), perform Sal�t (pray) on foot or riding.[2] And when you are in safety, offer the Sal�t (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).

**240.** 240. And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year�s maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honourable (e.g. lawful marriage). And All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise[3].

**241.** 241. And for divorced women, maintenance (should be provided) on reasonable (scale). This is a duty on Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**242.** 242. Thus All�h makes clear His Ay�t (Laws) to you, in order that you may understand.

**243.** 243. Did you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? All�h said to them, "Die". And then He restored them to life. Truly, All�h is full of bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.

**244.** 244. And fight in the Way of All�h and know that All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**245.** 245. Who is he that will lend to All�h a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times? And it is All�h that decreases or increases (your provisions), and unto Him you shall return.

**246.** 246. Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) M�s� (Moses)? When they said to a Prophet of theirs, "Appoint for us a king and we will fight in All�h�s Way." He said, "Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you?" They said, "Why should we not fight in All�h�s Way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)?" But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And All�h is All-Aware of the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**247.** 247. And their Prophet (Samuel ???? ??????) said to them, "Indeed All�h has appointed T�l�t (Saul) as a king over you." They said, "How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth." He said: "Verily, All�h has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And All�h grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knower."

**248.** 248. And their Prophet (Samuel ???? ??????) said to them: Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-T�b�t (a wooden box), wherein is Sak�nah [1] (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which M�s� (Moses) and H�r�n (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.

**249.** 249. Then when T�l�t (Saul) set out with the army, he said: "Verily! All�h will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand." Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: "We have no power this day against J�l�t (Goliath) and his hosts." But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet All�h, said: "How often a small group overcame a mighty host by All�h�s Leave?" And All�h is with As-S�bir�n (the patient).

**250.** 250. And when they advanced to meet J�l�t (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: "Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and set firm our feet and make us victorious over the disbelieving people."

**251.** 251. So they routed them by All�h�s Leave and D�w�d (David) killed J�l�t (Goliath), and All�h gave him [D�w�d (David)] the kingdom [after the death of T�l�t (Saul) and Samuel] and Al-Hikmah (Prophethood),[1] and taught him of that which He willed. And if All�h did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But All�h is full of bounty to the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**252.** 252. These are the Verses of All�h, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of All�h).[2]

**253.** 253. Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them All�h spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to ��s� (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidence, and supported him with R�h-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]. If All�h had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of All�h had come to them, but they differed - some of them believed and others disbelieved. If All�h had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but All�h does what He likes.

**254.** 254. O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the Z�lim�n (wrong-doers).

**255.** 255. All�h! L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kurs� [1] extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great. [This Verse 2:255 is called Ayat-ul-Kurs� ]

**256.** 256. There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in T�gh�t [2] and believes in All�h, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**257.** 257. All�h is the Wal� (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Auliy� (supporters and helpers) are T�gh�t [false deities and false leaders], they bring them out from light into darkness. Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever. (See V.2:81,82)

**258.** 258. Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibr�h�m (Abraham) about his Lord (All�h), because All�h had given him the kingdom? When Ibr�h�m (Abraham) said (to him): "My Lord (All�h) is He Who gives life and causes death." He said, "I give life and cause death." Ibr�h�m (Abraham) said, "Verily! All�h brings the sun from the east; then bring it you from the west." So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And All�h guides not the people, who are Z�lim�n (wrong-doers).

**259.** 259. Or like the one who passed by a town while it had tumbled over its roofs. He said: "Oh! How will All�h ever bring it to life after its death?" So All�h caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: "How long did you remain (dead)?" He (the man) said: "(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day". He said: "Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh". When this was clearly shown to him, he said, "I know (now) that All�h is Able to do all things."

**260.** 260. And (remember) when Ibr�h�m (Abraham) said, "My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead." He (All�h) said: "Do you not believe?" He [Ibr�h�m (Abraham)] said: "Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in Faith." He said: "Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise."

**261.** 261. The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the Way of All�h, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. All�h gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knower.

**262.** 262. Those who spend their wealth in the Cause of All�h, and do not follow up their gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury, their reward is with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

**263.** 263. Kind words and forgiving of faults are better than Sadaqah (charity) followed by injury. And All�h is Rich (Free of all needs) and He is Most-Forbearing.

**264.** 264. O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in All�h, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And All�h does not guide the disbelieving people.

**265.** 265. And the likeness of those who spend their wealth seeking All�h�s Pleasure while they in their ownselves are sure and certain that All�h will reward them (for their spending in His Cause), is the likeness of a garden on a height; heavy rain falls on it and it doubles its yield of harvest. And if it does not receive heavy rain, light rain suffices it. And All�h is All-Seer (knows well) of what you do.

**266.** 266. Would any of you wish to have a garden with date-palms and vines, with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for him therein, while he is striken with old age, and his children are weak (not able to look after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does All�h make clear His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses) to you that you may give thought.[1]

**267.** 267. O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein. And know that All�h is Rich (Free of all needs), and Worthy of all praise.

**268.** 268. Shait�n (Satan) threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit Fahsh� (evil deeds, illegal sexual intercourse, sins); whereas All�h promises you Forgiveness from Himself and Bounty, and All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knower.

**269.** 269. He grants Hikmah[2] to whom He pleases, and he, to whom Hikmah is granted, is indeed granted abundant good. But none remember (will receive admonition) except men of understanding.

**270.** 270. And whatever you spend for spendings (e.g., in Sadaqah - charity for All�h�s Cause) or whatever vow you make, be sure All�h knows it all. And for the Z�lim�n (wrong-doers) there are no helpers.

**271.** 271. If you disclose your Sadaq�t (alms-giving), it is well; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (All�h) will expiate you some of your sins. And All�h is Well-Acquainted with what you do.

**272.** 272. Not upon you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is their guidance, but All�h guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend in good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not except seeking All�h�s Countenance. And whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.

**273.** 273. (Charity is) for Fuqar� (the poor), who in All�h�s Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land (for trade or work). The one who knows them not, thinks that they are rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not beg of people at all.[1] And whatever you spend in good, surely, All�h knows it well.

**274.** 274. Those who spend their wealth (in All�h�s Cause) by night and day, in secret and in public, they shall have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.[2]

**275.** 275. Those who eat Rib� [1] (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shait�n (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: "Trading is only like Rib� (usury)," whereas All�h has permitted trading and forbidden Rib� (usury). So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Rib� (usury) shall not be punished for the past; his case is for All�h (to judge); but whoever returns [to Rib� (usury)], such are the dwellers of the Fire - they will abide therein.

**276.** 276. All�h will destroy Rib� (usury) and will give increase for Sadaq�t (deeds of charity, alms, etc.) And All�h likes not the disbelievers, sinners.

**277.** 277. Truly those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t they will have their reward with their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

**278.** 278. O you who believe! Be afraid of All�h and give up what remains (due to you) from Rib� (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers.[2]

**279.** 279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from All�h and His Messenger[3] but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).

**280.** 280. And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay, but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know.[4]

**281.** 281. And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to All�h. Then every person shall be paid what he earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

**282.** 282. O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as All�h has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear All�h, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable to dictate for himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term, that is more just with All�h; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. Let neither scribe nor witness suffer any harm, but if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So be afraid of All�h; and All�h teaches you. And All�h is the All-Knower of each and everything.

**283.** 283. And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging)[1]; then if one of you entrust the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of All�h, his Lord. And conceal not the evidence for he, who hides it, surely his heart is sinful. And All�h is All-Knower of what you do.

**284.** 284. To All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and whether you disclose what is in your ownselves or conceal it, All�h will call you to account for it. Then He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And All�h is Able to do all things.

**285.** 285. The Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in All�h, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), "We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers" - and they say, "We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all)."

**286.** 286. All�h burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. "Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maul� (Patron, Supporter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.[2]"
