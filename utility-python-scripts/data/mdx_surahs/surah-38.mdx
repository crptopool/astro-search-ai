# Surah 38: The Letter "Saad" (Sad)

**1.** 1. S�d.
[These letters (S�d etc.) are one of the miracles of the Quran and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings]. By the Quran full of reminding.

**2.** 2. Nay, those who disbelieve are in false pride and opposition.

**3.** 3. How many a generation have We destroyed before them! And they cried out when there was no longer time for escape.

**4.** 4. And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) has come to them from among themselves. And the disbelievers say: "This (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is a sorcerer, a liar.

**5.** 5. "Has he made the �lihah (gods) (all) into One Il�h (God - All�h). Verily, this is a curious thing!"

**6.** 6. And the leaders among them went about (saying): "Go on, and remain constant to your �lihah (gods)! Verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!

**7.** 7. "We have not heard (the like) of this in the religion of these later days (i.e. Christianity). This is nothing but an invention! [Tafsir Al-Qurtubi]

**8.** 8. "Has the Reminder been sent down to him (alone) from among us?" Nay, but they are in doubt about My Reminder (this Qur��n)! Nay, but they have not tasted (My) Torment!

**9.** 9. Or have they the treasures of the Mercy of your Lord, the All-Mighty, the Real Bestower?

**10.** 10. Or is it that the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them is theirs? If so, let them ascend up with means (to the heavens)!

**11.** 11. (As they denied All�h�s Message) they will be a defeated host like the Confederates of the old times (who were defeated).

**12.** 12. Before them (were many who) belied (Messengers) - the people of N�h (Noah); and ��d; and Fir�aun (Pharaoh) the man of stakes (with which he used to punish the people),

**13.** 13. And Tham�d, and the people of L�t (Lot), and the Dwellers of the Wood: such were the Confederates.

**14.** 14. Not one of them but belied the Messengers; therefore My Torment was justified,

**15.** 15. And these only wait for a single Saihah [shout (i.e. the blowing of the Trumpet by the angel Isr�fil -)] there will be no pause or ending thereto [till everything will perish except All�h (the only God full of Majesty, Bounty and Honour)].

**16.** 16. They say: "Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittan� (i.e. our Record of good and bad deeds so that we may see it) before the Day of Reckoning!"

**17.** 17. Be patient (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) of what they say, and remember Our slave D�w�d (David), endued with power. Verily, he was ever oft-returning in all matters and in repentance (toward All�h).

**18.** 18. Verily, We made the mountains to glorify Our Praises with him [D�w�d (David)] in the �Ash� (i.e. after the mid-day till sunset) and Ishr�q (i.e. after the sunrise till mid-day).

**19.** 19. And (so did) the birds assembled: all obedient to him [D�w�d (David)] [i.e. they came and glorified All�h�s Praises along with him]. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi ).

**20.** 20. We made his kingdom strong and gave him Al-Hikmah (Prophethood) and sound judgement in speech and decision.

**21.** 21. And has the news of the litigants reached you? When they climbed over the wall into (his) Mihr�b (a praying place or a private room);

**22.** 22. When they entered in upon D�w�d (David), he was terrified of them. They said: "Fear not! (We are) two litigants, one of whom has wronged the other, therefore judge between us with truth, and treat us not with injustice, and guide us to the Right Way.

**23.** 23. Verily, this my brother (in religion) has ninety-nine ewes, while I have (only) one ewe, and he says: "Hand it over to me, and he overpowered me in speech."

**24.** 24. [D�w�d (David)] said (immediately without listening to the opponent): "He has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes. And, verily, many partners oppress one another, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and they are few." And D�w�d (David) guessed that We have tried him and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to All�h) in repentance.

**25.** 25. So We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of (final) return (Paradise).

**26.** 26. O D�w�d (David)! Verily! We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your desire - for it will mislead you from the Path of All�h. Verily, those who wander astray from the Path of All�h (shall) have a severe torment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.

**27.** 27. And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Isl�mic Monotheism) from the Fire!

**28.** 28. Shall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsid�n (those who associate partners in worship with All�h and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) as the Fujj�r (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?

**29.** 29. (This is) a Book (the Qur��n) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.

**30.** 30. And to D�w�d (David) We gave Sulaim�n (Solomon). How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!

**31.** 31. When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of the highest breed [for Jih�d (holy fighting in All�h�s Cause)].

**32.** 32. He said: "I did love the good (these horses) instead of remembering my Lord (in my �Asr prayer)" till the time was over, and (the sun) had hidden in the veil (of night).

**33.** 33. Then he said "Bring them (horses) back to me." Then he began to pass his hand over their legs and their necks (till the end of the display).

**34.** 34. And indeed, We did try Sulaim�n (Solomon) and We placed on his throne Jasad (a devil, so he lost his kingdom for a while) and he did return (to All�h with obedience and in repentance, and to his throne and kingdom by the Grace of All�h).

**35.** 35. He said: "My Lord! Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me: Verily, You are the Bestower."

**36.** 36. So, We subjected to him the wind; it blew gently by his order whithersoever he willed,

**37.** 37. And also the Shay�t�n (devils) from the jinn (including) every kind of builder and diver,

**38.** 38. And also others bound in fetters.

**39.** 39. [All�h said to Sulaim�n (Solomon)]: "This is Our gift: so spend you or withhold, no account will be asked (of you)."

**40.** 40. And verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good (final) return (Paradise).

**41.** 41. And remember Our slave Ayy�b (Job), when he invoked his Lord (saying): "Verily Shait�n (Satan) has touched me with distress (by ruining my health) and torment (by ruining my wealth)!

**42.** 42. (All�h said to him): "Strike the ground with your foot: This is (a spring of) water to wash in, cool and a (refreshing) drink."

**43.** 43. And We gave him (back) his family, and along with them the like thereof, as a Mercy from Us, and a Reminder for those who understand.

**44.** 44. "And take in your hand a bundle of thin grass and strike therewith (your wife), and break not your oath.[1] Truly! We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!

**45.** 45. And remember Our slaves, Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ish�q (Isaac), and Ya�q�b (Jacob), (all) owners of strength (in worshipping Us) and (also) of religious understanding.

**46.** 46. Verily, We did choose them by granting them (a good thing, - i.e.) the remembrance of the Home [in the Hereafter and they used to make the people remember it, and also they used to invite the people to obey All�h and to do good deeds for the Hereafter].

**47.** 47. And they are with Us, verily, of the chosen and the best!

**48.** 48. And remember Ism��l (Ishmael), Alyasa� (Elisha), and Dhul-Kifl (Isaiah), all are among the best.

**49.** 49. This is a Reminder. And verily, for the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) is a good final return (Paradise),

**50.** 50. �Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), whose doors will be opened for them.

**51.** 51. Therein they will recline; therein they will call for fruits in abundance and drinks;

**52.** 52. And beside them will be Q�sir�t-at-Tarf [chaste females (wives) restraining their glances (desiring none except their husbands)], (and) of equal ages.

**53.** 53. This it is what you (Al-Muttaq�n - the pious - see V.2:2) are promised for the Day of Reckoning!

**54.** 54. (It will be said to them)! Verily, this is Our Provision which will never finish.

**55.** 55. This is so! And for the T�gh�n (transgressors, the disobedient to All�h and His Messenger - disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h, criminals) will be an evil final return (Fire).

**56.** 56. Hell! Where they will burn, and worst (indeed) is that place to rest!

**57.** 57. This is so! Then let them taste it - a boiling fluid and dirty wound discharges.

**58.** 58. And other (torments) of similar kind - all together!

**59.** 59. This is a troop entering with you (in Hell), no welcome for them! Verily, they shall burn in the Fire!

**60.** 60. (The followers of the misleaders will say): "Nay, you (too)! No welcome for you! It is you (misleaders) who brought this upon us (because you misled us in the world), so evil is this place to stay in!"

**61.** 61. They will say: "Our Lord! Whoever brought this upon us, add to him a double torment in the Fire!"

**62.** 62. And they will say: "What is the matter with us that we see not men whom we used to count among the bad ones?"

**63.** 63. Did we take them as an object of mockery, or have (our) eyes failed to perceive them?"

**64.** 64. Verily, that is the very truth - the mutual dispute of the people of the Fire!

**65.** 65. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "I am only a warner and there is no Il�h (God) except All�h (none has the right to be worshipped but All�h) the One, the Irresistible,

**66.** 66. "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving."

**67.** 67. Say: "That (this Qur��n) is a great news,

**68.** 68. "From which you turn away!

**69.** 69. "I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing (about the creation of Adam).

**70.** 70. "Only this has been revealed to me, that I am a plain warner."

**71.** 71. (Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "Truly I am going to create man from clay".

**72.** 72. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him."

**73.** 73. So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them:

**74.** 74. Except Ibl�s (Satan): he was proud[1] and was one of the disbelievers.

**75.** 75. (All�h) said: "O Ibl�s (Satan)! What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands[2]. Are you too proud (to fall prostrate to Adam) or are you one of the high exalted?"

**76.** 76. [Ibl�s (Satan)] said: "I am better than he. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay."

**77.** 77. (All�h) said: "Then get out from here; for verily you are outcast.

**78.** 78. "And verily My Curse is on you till the Day of Recompense."

**79.** 79. [Ibl�s (Satan)] said: "My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are resurrected."

**80.** 80. (All�h) said: "Verily! You are of those allowed respite."

**81.** 81. "Till the Day of the time appointed."

**82.** 82. [Ibl�s (Satan)] said: "By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,

**83.** 83. "Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism)."

**84.** 84. (All�h) said: "The Truth is - and the Truth I say -

**85.** 85. That I will fill Hell with you [Ibl�s (Satan)] and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together."

**86.** 86. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "No wage do I ask of you for this (the Qur��n), nor am I one of the Mutakallif�n (those who pretend and fabricate things which do not exist).

**87.** 87. "It (this Qur��n) is only a Reminder for all the ��lam�n (mankind and jinn).

**88.** 88. "And you shall certainly know the truth of it after a while".
