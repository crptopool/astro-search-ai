# Surah 87: The Most High (Al-A'la)

**1.** 1. Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,

**2.** 2. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it.

**3.** 3. And Who has measured (preordainments for everything even to be blessed or wretched); and then guided (i.e. showed mankind the right as well as the wrong paths, and guided the animals to pasture).

**4.** 4. And Who brings out the pasturage,

**5.** 5. And then makes it dark stubble.

**6.** 6. We shall make you to recite (the Qur��n), so you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) shall not forget (it),

**7.** 7. Except what All�h may will. He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.

**8.** 8. And We shall make easy for you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) the easy way (i.e. the doing of righteous deeds).

**9.** 9. Therefore remind (men) in case the reminder profits (them).

**10.** 10. The reminder will be received by him who fears (All�h),

**11.** 11. But it will be avoided by the wretched,

**12.** 12. Who will enter the great Fire (and will be made to taste its burning).

**13.** 13. There he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).

**14.** 14. Indeed whosoever purifies himself (by avoiding polytheism and accepting Isl�mic Monotheism) shall achieve success,

**15.** 15. And remembers (glorifies) the Name of his Lord (worships none but All�h), and prays (five compulsory prayers and Naw�fil - additional prayers).

**16.** 16. Nay, you prefer the life of this world,

**17.** 17. Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.

**18.** 18. Verily, this is in the former Scriptures -

**19.** 19. The Scriptures of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) and M�s� (Moses) (?????? ??????).
