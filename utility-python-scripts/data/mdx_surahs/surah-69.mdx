# Surah 69: The Reality (Al-Haqqah)

**1.** 1. The Inevitable (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!

**2.** 2. What is the Inevitable?

**3.** 3. And what will make you know what the Inevitable is?

**4.** 4. Tham�d and ��d people denied the Q�ri�ah (the striking Hour of Judgement)!

**5.** 5. As for Tham�d, they were destroyed by the awful cry!

**6.** 6. And as for ��d, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind!

**7.** 7. Which All�h imposed on them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date-palms!

**8.** 8. Do you see any remnants of them?

**9.** 9. And Fir�aun (Pharaoh), and those before him, and the cities overthrown [the towns of the people of [L�t (Lot)] committed sin.

**10.** 10. And they disobeyed their Lord�s Messenger, so He seized them with a strong punishment.

**11.** 11. Verily, when the water rose beyond its limits [N�h�s (Noah) Flood], We carried you (mankind) in the floating [ship that was constructed by N�h (Noah)]

**12.** 12. That We might make it (Noah�s ship) an admonition for you and that it might be retained by the retaining ears.

**13.** 13. Then when the Trumpet will be blown with one blowing (the first one).

**14.** 14. And the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.

**15.** 15. Then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall.

**16.** 16. And the heaven will be rent asunder, for that Day it (the heaven) will be frail and torn up.

**17.** 17. And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.

**18.** 18. That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of you will be hidden.

**19.** 19. Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: "Here! read my Record!

**20.** 20. "Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!"

**21.** 21. So he shall be in a life, well-pleasing.

**22.** 22. In a lofty Paradise,

**23.** 23. The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.

**24.** 24. Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!

**25.** 25. But as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: "I wish that I had not been given my Record!

**26.** 26. "And that I had never known how my Account is!

**27.** 27. "Would that it had been my end (death)!

**28.** 28. "My wealth has not availed me;

**29.** 29. "My power (and arguments to defend myself) have gone from me!"

**30.** 30. (It will be said): "Seize him and fetter him;

**31.** 31. Then throw him in the blazing Fire.

**32.** 32. "Then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!"

**33.** 33. Verily, he used not to believe in All�h, the Most Great,

**34.** 34. And urged not on the feeding of Al-Misk�n (the poor).[1]

**35.** 35. So no friend has he here this Day,

**36.** 36. Nor any food except filth from the washing of wounds.

**37.** 37. None will eat it except the Kh�ti��n (sinners, disbelievers, polytheists).

**38.** 38. So I swear by whatsoever you see,

**39.** 39. And by whatsoever you see not,

**40.** 40. That this is verily, the word of an honoured Messenger [i.e. Jibr�l (Gabriel) or Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? which he has brought from All�h].

**41.** 41. It is not the word of a poet: little is that you believe!

**42.** 42. Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller): little is that you remember!

**43.** 43. This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**44.** 44. And if he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) had forged a false saying concerning Us (All�h ?? ?????),

**45.** 45. We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might),

**46.** 46. And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta),

**47.** 47. And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him.

**48.** 48. And verily, this (Qur�an) is a Reminder for the Muttaq�n (the pious. See V.2:2).

**49.** 49. And verily, We know that there are some among you that belie (this Qur��n). (Tafsir At-Tabar�)

**50.** 50. And indeed it (this Qur��n) will be an anguish for the disbelievers (on the Day of Resurrection).[1]

**51.** 51. And verily, it (this Qur��n) is an absolute truth with certainty.[2]

**52.** 52. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.[3]
