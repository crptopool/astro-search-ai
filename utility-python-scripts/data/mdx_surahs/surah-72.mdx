# Surah 72: The Jinn (Al-Jinn)

**1.** 1. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "It has been revealed to me that a group (from three to ten in number) of jinn[1] listened (to this Qur��n). They said: �Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation (this Qur��n)!

**2.** 2. �It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord (All�h).

**3.** 3. �And He, exalted be the Majesty of our Lord, has taken neither a wife nor a son (or offspring or children).[2]

**4.** 4. �And that the foolish among us [i.e. Ibl�s (Satan) or the polytheists amongst the jinn] used to utter against All�h that which was an enormity in falsehood.

**5.** 5. �And verily, we thought that men and jinn would not utter a lie against All�h.

**6.** 6. �And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression.

**7.** 7. �And they thought as you thought, that All�h will not send any Messenger (to mankind or jinn).

**8.** 8. �And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires.

**9.** 9. �And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush.

**10.** 10. �And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them a Right Path.

**11.** 11. �There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups having different ways (religious sects).

**12.** 12. �And we think that we cannot escape (the punishment of) All�h in the earth, nor can we escape Him by flight.

**13.** 13. �And indeed when we heard the Guidance (this Qur��n), we believed therein (Isl�mic Monotheism), and whosoever believes in his Lord shall have no fear, either of a decrease in the reward of his good deeds or an increase in the punishment for his sins.

**14.** 14. �And of us some are Muslims (who have submitted to All�h, after listening to this Qur��n), and of us some are Al-Q�sit�n (disbelievers - those who have deviated from the Right Path)�. And whosoever has embraced Isl�m (i.e. has become a Muslim by submitting to All�h), then such have sought the Right Path."

**15.** 15. And as for the Q�sit�n (disbelievers who deviated from the Right Path), they shall be firewood for Hell,

**16.** 16. If they (non-Muslims) had believed in All�h, and went on the Right Way (i.e. Isl�m) We would surely have bestowed on them water (rain) in abundance.

**17.** 17. That We might try them thereby. And whosoever turns away from the Reminder of his Lord (i.e. this Qur��n, - and practise not its laws and orders), He will cause him to enter in a severe torment (i.e. Hell).

**18.** 18. And the mosques are for All�h (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with All�h.[1]

**19.** 19. And when the slave of All�h (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) stood up invoking Him (his Lord - All�h) in prayer they (the jinn) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet�s recitation).

**20.** 20. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "I invoke only my Lord (All�h Alone), and I associate none as partners along with Him."

**21.** 21. Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path."

**22.** 22. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "None can protect me from All�h�s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him.

**23.** 23. "(Mine is) but conveyance (of the truth) from All�h and His Messages (of Isl�mic Monotheism), and whosoever disobeys All�h and His Messenger, then Verily, for him is the Fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever."[2]

**24.** 24. Till, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who it is that is weaker concerning helpers and less important concerning numbers.

**25.** 25. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "I know not whether (the punishment) which you are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term.

**26.** 26. "(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghaib (Unseen)."

**27.** 27. Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of unseen as much as He likes), and then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him.

**28.** 28. [He (All�h) protects them (the Messengers)], till He sees that they (the Messengers) have conveyed the Messages of their Lord (All�h). And He (All�h) surrounds all that which is with them, and He (All�h) keeps count of all things (i.e. He knows the exact number of everything).
