# Surah 93: The Morning Hours (Ad-Duhaa)

**1.** 1. By the forenoon (after sunrise).[1]

**2.** 2. By the night when it darkens (and stand still).

**3.** 3. Your Lord (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) has neither forsaken you nor hates you.

**4.** 4. And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).

**5.** 5. And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.

**6.** 6. Did He not find you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) an orphan and gave you a refuge?

**7.** 7. And He found you unaware (of the Qur��n, its laws, and Prophethood) and guided you?

**8.** 8. And He found you poor and made you rich (self-sufficient with self-contentment)?

**9.** 9. Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression.

**10.** 10. And repulse not the beggar.

**11.** 11. And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces).
