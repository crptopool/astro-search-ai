# Surah 54: The Moon (Al-Qamar)

**1.** 1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder (the people of Makkah requested Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? to show them a miracle, so he showed them the splitting of the moon).[2]

**2.** 2. And if they see a sign, they turn away, and say: "This is continuous magic."

**3.** 3. They belied (the Verses of All�h - this Qur��n), and followed their own lusts. And every matter will be settled (according to the kind of deeds: good deeds will take their doers to Paradise, and similarly evil deeds will take their doers to Hell).

**4.** 4. And indeed there has come to them news (in this Qur��n) wherein there is (enough warning) to check (them from evil),

**5.** 5. Perfect wisdom (this Qur��n), but (the preaching of) warners benefit them not.

**6.** 6. So (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) withdraw from them. The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing.

**7.** 7. They will come forth, with humbled eyes from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad,

**8.** 8. Hastening towards the caller. The disbelievers will say: "This is a hard Day."

**9.** 9. The people of N�h (Noah) denied (their Messenger) before them. They rejected Our slave, and said: "A madman!" and he was insolently rebuked and threatened.

**10.** 10. Then he invoked his Lord (saying): "I have been overcome, so help (me)!"

**11.** 11. So We opened the gates of the heaven with water pouring forth.

**12.** 12. And We caused springs to gush forth from the earth. So the waters (of the heaven and the earth) met for a matter predestined.

**13.** 13. And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails,

**14.** 14. Floating under Our Eyes: a reward for him who had been rejected!

**15.** 15. And indeed, We have left this as a sign. Then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?

**16.** 16. Then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings?

**17.** 17. And We have indeed made the Qur��n easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?

**18.** 18. ��d (people) belied (their Prophet, H�d); then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings?

**19.** 19. Verily, We sent against them a furious wind of harsh voice on a day of evil omen and continuous calamity.

**20.** 20. Plucking out men as if they were uprooted stems of date-palms.

**21.** 21. Then, how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings?

**22.** 22. And We have indeed made the Qur��n easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?

**23.** 23. Tham�d (people also) belied the warnings.

**24.** 24. And they said: "A man, alone among us - shall we follow him? Truly then we should be in error and distress (or madness)!"

**25.** 25. "Is it that the Reminder is sent to him [Prophet S�lih ???? ??????] alone from among us? Nay, he is an insolent liar!"

**26.** 26. Tomorrow they will come to know who is the liar, the insolent one!

**27.** 27. Verily, We are sending the she-camel as a test for them. So watch them [O S�lih ???? ??????], and be patient!

**28.** 28. And inform them that the water is to be shared between (her and) them, each one�s right to drink being established (by turns).

**29.** 29. But they called their comrade and he took (a sword) and killed (her).

**30.** 30. Then, how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings?

**31.** 31. Verily, We sent against them a single Saihah (torment - awful cry), and they became like the stubble of a fold-builder.

**32.** 32. And indeed, We have made the Qur��n easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?

**33.** 33. The people of L�t (Lot) belied the warnings.

**34.** 34. Verily, We sent against them a violent storm of stones (which destroyed them all), except the family of L�t (Lot), them We saved in the last hour of the night,

**35.** 35. As a Favour from Us. Thus do We reward him who gives thanks (by obeying Us).

**36.** 36. And he [L�t (Lot)] indeed had warned them of Our Seizure (punishment), but they did doubt the warnings!

**37.** 37. And they indeed sought to shame his guest (by asking to commit sodomy with them). So We blinded their eyes, (saying) "Then taste you My Torment and My Warnings."

**38.** 38. And verily, an abiding torment seized them early in the morning.

**39.** 39. "Then taste you My Torment and My Warnings."

**40.** 40. And indeed, We have made the Qur��n easy to understand and remember; then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?

**41.** 41. And indeed, warnings came to the people of Fir�aun (Pharaoh) [through M�s� (Moses) and H�r�n (Aaron)].

**42.** 42. (They) belied all Our Signs, so We seized them with a Seizure of the All-Mighty, All-Capable (Omnipotent).

**43.** 43. Are your disbelievers (O Quraish!) better than these [nations of N�h (Noah), L�t (Lot), S�lih, and the people of Fir�aun (Pharaoh) who were destroyed)? Or have you an immunity (against Our Torment) in the Divine Scriptures?

**44.** 44. Or say they: "We are a great multitude, victorious?"

**45.** 45. Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs.

**46.** 46. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.

**47.** 47. Verily the Mujrim�n (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals) are in error (in this world) and will burn (in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter).

**48.** 48. The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire (it will be said to them): "Taste you the touch of Hell!"[1]

**49.** 49. Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z).

**50.** 50. And Our Commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.

**51.** 51. And indeed, We have destroyed your likes; then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?

**52.** 52. And everything they have done is noted in (their) Records (of deeds).

**53.** 53. And everything, small and big, is written down (in Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z already beforehand i.e. before it befalls, or is done by its doer: ??????? ??????) (See the Qur��n V.57:22 and its footnote).

**54.** 54. Verily, The Muttaq�n (the pious - see V.2:2), will be in the midst of Gardens and Rivers (Paradise).

**55.** 55. In a seat of truth (i.e. Paradise), near the Omnipotent King (All�h, the One, the All-Blessed, the Most High, the Owner of Majesty and Honour).
