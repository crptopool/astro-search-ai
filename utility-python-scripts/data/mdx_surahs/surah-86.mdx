# Surah 86: The Nightcommer (At-Tariq)

**1.** 1. By the heaven, and At-T�riq (the night-comer, i.e. the bright star);

**2.** 2. And what will make you to know what At-T�riq (night-comer) is?

**3.** 3. (It is) the star of piercing brightness;

**4.** 4. There is no human being but has a protector over him (or her) (i.e. angels in charge of each human being guarding him, writing his good and bad deeds)[1]

**5.** 5. So let man see from what he is created!

**6.** 6. He is created from a water gushing forth,

**7.** 7. Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.

**8.** 8. Verily, (All�h) is Able to bring him back (to life)!

**9.** 9. The Day when all the secrets (deeds, prayers, fasting, etc.) will be examined (as to their truth).

**10.** 10. Then he will have no power, nor any helper.

**11.** 11. By the sky (having rain clouds) which gives rain, again and again.

**12.** 12. And the earth which splits (with the growth of trees and plants).

**13.** 13. Verily, this (the Qur��n) is the Word that separates (the truth from falsehood, and commands strict laws for mankind to cut the roots of evil).

**14.** 14. And it is not a thing for amusement.

**15.** 15. Verily, they are but plotting a plot (against you O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????).

**16.** 16. And I (too) am planning a plan.

**17.** 17. So give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.
