# Surah 4: The Women (An-Nisa)

**1.** 1. O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Haww� (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women; and fear All�h through Whom you demand (your mutual rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)[1]. Surely, All�h is Ever an All-Watcher over you.

**2.** 2. And give unto orphans their property and do not exchange (your) bad things for (their) good ones; and devour not their substance (by adding it) to your substance. Surely, this is a great sin.[2]

**3.** 3. And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan-girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.

**4.** 4. And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as All�h has made it lawful).

**5.** 5. And give not unto the foolish your property which All�h has made a means of support for you,[3] but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.

**6.** 6. And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them, but consume it not wastefully and hastily fearing that they should grow up, and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his labour). And when you release their property to them, take witness in their presence; and All�h is All-Sufficient in taking account.

**7.** 7. There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether the property be small or large - a legal share.

**8.** 8. And when the relatives and the orphans and Al-Mas�k�n (the poor) are present at the time of division, give them out of the property, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.

**9.** 9. And let those (executors and guardians) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left weak offspring behind. So let them fear All�h and speak right words.

**10.** 10. Verily, those who unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!

**11.** 11. All�h commands you as regards your children�s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers (or sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by All�h. And All�h is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.

**12.** 12. In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave, their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from All�h; and All�h is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.

**13.** 13. These are the limits (set by) All�h (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.

**14.** 14. And whosoever disobeys All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.

**15.** 15. And those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the evidence of four witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them (i.e. women) to houses until death comes to them or All�h ordains for them some (other) way.[1]

**16.** 16. And the two persons (man and woman) among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, hurt them both.[2] And if they repent (promise All�h that they will never repeat, i.e. commit illegal sexual intercourse and other similar sins) and do righteous good deeds, leave them alone. Surely, All�h is Ever All-Forgiving (the One Who forgives and accepts repentance), (and He is) Most Merciful.

**17.** 17. All�h accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom All�h will forgive and All�h is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.

**18.** 18. And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: "Now I repent;" nor of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful torment.

**19.** 19. O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will; and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr [3] you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse; and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and All�h brings through it a great deal of good.

**20.** 20. But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a Qint�r (of gold i.e. a great amount as Mahr) take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin?

**21.** 21. And how could you take it (back) while you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant?

**22.** 22. And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way.

**23.** 23. Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father�s sisters, your mother�s sisters, your brother�s daughters, your sister�s daughters, your foster mother who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters, your wives� mothers, your step daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in - but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters), - the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins, and two sisters in wedlock at the same time, except for what has already passed; verily, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**24.** 24. Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Thus has All�h ordained for you. All others are lawful, provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property, desiring chastity, not committing illegal sexual intercourse, so with those of whom you have enjoyed sexual relations, give them their Mahr as prescribed; but if after a Mahr is prescribed, you agree mutually (to give more), there is no sin on you. Surely, All�h is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**25.** 25. And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free, believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those (slaves) whom your right hands possess, and All�h has full knowledge about your Faith; you are one from another. Wed them with the permission of their own folk (guardians, Auliy� or masters) and give them their Mahr according to what is reasonable; they (the above said captive and slave-girls) should be chaste, not committing illegal sex, nor taking boy-friends. And after they have been taken in wedlock, if they commit illegal sexual intercourse, their punishment is half that for free (unmarried) women.[1] This is for him among you who is afraid of being harmed in his religion or in his body; but it is better for you that you practise self-restraint, and All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**26.** 26. All�h wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you, and to show you the ways of those before you, and accept your repentance, and All�h is All-Knower, All-Wise.

**27.** 27. All�h wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you (believers) should deviate tremendously away (from the Right Path).

**28.** 28. All�h wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak (cannot be patient to leave sexual intercourse with woman).

**29.** 29. O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, All�h is Most Merciful to you.[1]

**30.** 30. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for All�h.

**31.** 31. If you avoid the great sins[2] which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise).

**32.** 32. And wish not for the things in which All�h has made some of you to excel others. For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned, and ask All�h of His Bounty. Surely, All�h is Ever All-Knower of everything.

**33.** 33. And to everyone, We have appointed heirs of that (property) left by parents and relatives. To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood), give them their due portion (by Wasiyyah - will)[3]. Truly, All�h is Ever a Witness over all things.

**34.** 34. Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because All�h has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to All�h and to their husbands), and guard in the husband�s absence what All�h orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband�s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, All�h is Ever Most High, Most Great.

**35.** 35. If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from her�s; if they both wish for peace, All�h will cause their reconciliation. Indeed All�h is Ever All-Knower, Well-Acquainted with all things.

**36.** 36. Worship All�h and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Mas�k�n (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess. Verily, All�h does not like such as are proud and boastful.

**37.** 37. Those who are miserly and enjoin miserliness on other men and hide what All�h has bestowed upon them of His Bounties. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a disgraceful torment.[1]

**38.** 38. And (also) those who spend of their substance to be seen of men, and believe not in All�h and the Last Day [they are the friends of Shait�n (Satan)], and whoever takes Shait�n (Satan) as an intimate; then what a dreadful intimate he has!

**39.** 39. And what loss have they if they had believed in All�h and in the Last Day, and they spend out of what All�h has given them for sustenance? And All�h is Ever All-Knower of them.

**40.** 40. Surely! All�h wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a small ant),[1] but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.

**41.** 41. How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as a witness against these people?

**42.** 42. On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from All�h.[2]

**43.** 43. O you who believe! Approach not As-Sal�t (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Jan�ba ,(i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)[3]. Truly, All�h is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.

**44.** 44. Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the book (the Jews), purchasing the wrong path, and wish that you should go astray from the Right Path.

**45.** 45. All�h has full knowledge of your enemies, and All�h is Sufficient as a Wal� (Protector), and All�h is Sufficient as a Helper.

**46.** 46. Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: "We hear your word (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and disobey," and "Hear and let you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) hear nothing." And R�ina [1] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Isl�m). And if only they had said: "We hear and obey", and "Do make us understand," it would have been better for them, and more proper; but All�h has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few.

**47.** 47. O you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe in what We have revealed (to Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) confirming what is (already) with you, before We efface faces (by making them like the back of necks; without nose, mouth) and turn them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers[2]. And the Commandment of All�h is always executed.[3]

**48.** 48. Verily, All�h forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with All�h in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.[4]

**49.** 49. Have you not seen those (Jews and Christians)[5] who claim sanctity for themselves. Nay, but All�h sanctifies whom He wills, and they will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone.

**50.** 50. Look, how they invent a lie against All�h, and enough is that as a manifest sin.

**51.** 51. Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in Jibt and T�gh�t [6] and say to the disbelievers that they are better guided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims).

**52.** 52. They are those whom All�h has cursed, and he whom All�h curses, you will not find for him (any) helper,

**53.** 53. Or have they a share in the dominion? Then in that case they would not give mankind even a speck on the back of a date-stone.

**54.** 54. Or do they envy men (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and his followers) for what All�h has given them of His Bounty? Then We had already given the family of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) the Book and Al-Hikmah (As-Sunnah - Divine Revelation to those Prophets not written in the form of a book), and conferred upon them a great kingdom.

**55.** 55. Of them were (some) who believed in him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and of them were (some) who averted their faces from him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????); and enough is Hell for burning (them)[1].

**56.** 56. Surely! Those who disbelieved in Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment. Truly, All�h is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.

**57.** 57. But those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), abiding therein forever. Therein they shall have Azw�jun Mutahharatun [2] (purified mates or wives), and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening (Paradise)[3].

**58.** 58. Verily! All�h commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (All�h) gives you! Truly, All�h is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.

**59.** 59. O you who believe! Obey All�h and obey the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to All�h and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????), if you believe in All�h and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.

**60.** 60. Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the T�gh�t [1] (false judges) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shait�n (Satan) wishes to lead them far astray[2].

**61.** 61. And when it is said to them: "Come to what All�h has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)," you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) see the hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with aversion.

**62.** 62. How then, when a catastrophe befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, they come to you swearing by All�h, "We meant no more than goodwill and conciliation!"

**63.** 63. They (hypocrites) are those of whom All�h knows what is in their hearts; so turn aside from them (do not punish them) but admonish them, and speak to them an effective word (i.e. to believe in All�h, worship Him, obey Him, and be afraid of Him) to reach their innerselves.

**64.** 64. We sent no Messenger, but to be obeyed by All�h�s Leave. If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and begged All�h�s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found All�h All-Forgiving (One Who forgives and accepts repentance), Most Merciful.

**65.** 65. But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.

**66.** 66. And if We had ordered them (saying), "Kill yourselves (i.e. the innocent ones kill the guilty ones) or leave your homes," very few of them would have done it; but if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and would have strengthened their (Faith);

**67.** 67. And indeed We should then have bestowed upon them a great reward from Ourselves.

**68.** 68. And indeed We should have guided them to the Straight Way.

**69.** 69. And whoso obey All�h and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), then they will be in the company of those on whom All�h has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiq�n (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Sidd�q (??? ???? ???), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!

**70.** 70. Such is the Bounty from All�h, and All�h is Sufficient as All-Knower.

**71.** 71. O you who believe! Take your precautions, and either go forth (on an expedition) in parties, or go forth all together.

**72.** 72. There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in All�h�s Cause). If a misfortune befalls you, he says, "Indeed All�h has favoured me in that I was not present among them."

**73.** 73. But if a bounty (victory and booty) comes to you from All�h, he would surely say - as if there had never been ties of affection between you and him - "Oh! I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great success (a good share of booty)."

**74.** 74. Let those (believers) who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter fight in the Cause of All�h, and whoso fights in the Cause of All�h, and is killed or gets victory, We shall bestow on him a great reward.

**75.** 75. And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of All�h, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help."

**76.** 76. Those who believe, fight in the Cause of All�h, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of T�gh�t (Satan).[1] So fight you against the friends of Shait�n (Satan). Ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shait�n (Satan).

**77.** 77. Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear All�h or even more. They say: "Our Lord! Why have you ordained for us fighting? Would that You had granted us respite for a short period?" Say: "Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears All�h, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone.

**78.** 78. "Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!" And if some good reaches them, they say, "This is from All�h," but if some evil befalls them, they say, "This is from you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)." Say: "All things are from All�h," so what is wrong with these people that they fail to understand any word?

**79.** 79. Whatever of good reaches you, is from All�h, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as a Messenger to mankind, and All�h is Sufficient as a Witness.[2]

**80.** 80. He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), has indeed obeyed All�h, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as a watcher over them.[1]

**81.** 81. They say: "We are obedient," but when they leave you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), a section of them spend all night in planning other than what you say. But All�h records their nightly (plots). So turn aside from them (do not punish them), and put your trust in All�h. And All�h is Ever All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.

**82.** 82. Do they not then consider the Qur��n carefully? Had it been from other than All�h, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.

**83.** 83. When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); if only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of All�h upon you, you would have followed Shait�n (Satan), save a few of you.

**84.** 84. Then fight (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in the Cause of All�h, you are not tasked (held responsible) except for yourself, and incite the believers (to fight along with you), it may be that All�h will restrain the evil might of the disbelievers. And All�h is Stronger in Might and Stronger in punishing.

**85.** 85. Whosoever intercedes for a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in its burden. And All�h is Ever All-Able to do (and also an All-Witness to) everything.

**86.** 86. When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Certainly, All�h is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things.[2]

**87.** 87. All�h! L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Surely, He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who is truer in statement than All�h?

**88.** 88. Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites? All�h has cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they have earned. Do you want to guide him whom All�h has made to go astray? And he whom All�h has made to go astray, you will never find for him any way (of guidance).

**89.** 89. They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another). So take not Auliy� (protectors or friends) from them, till they emigrate in the Way of All�h (to Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). But if they turn back (from Isl�m), take (hold of) them and kill them wherever you find them, and take neither Auliy� (protectors or friends) nor helpers from them.

**90.** 90. Except those who join a group, between you and whom there is a treaty (of peace), or those who approach you with their breasts restraining from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. Had All�h willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. So if they withdraw from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, then All�h has opened no way for you against them.

**91.** 91. You will find others that wish to have security from you and security from their people. Every time they are sent back to temptation, they yield thereto. If they withdraw not from you, nor offer you peace, nor restrain their hands, take (hold of) them and kill them wherever you find them. In their case, We have provided you with a clear warrant against them.

**92.** 92. It is not for a believer to kill a believer except (that it be) by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a believing slave and a compensation (blood-money, i.e. Diya) be given to the deceased�s family unless they remit it. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is prescribed); and if he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation (blood-money - Diya) must be paid to his family, and a believing slave must be freed. And whoso finds this (the penance of freeing a slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance from All�h. And All�h is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**93.** 93. And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein; and the Wrath and the Curse of All�h are upon him, and a great punishment is prepared for him.[1]

**94.** 94. O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the Cause of All�h, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you (by embracing Isl�m): "You are not a believer"; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with All�h. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till All�h conferred on you His Favours (i.e. guided you to Isl�m), therefore, be cautious in discrimination. All�h is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.

**95.** 95. Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of All�h with their wealth and their lives. All�h has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, All�h has promised good (Paradise), but All�h has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward.

**96.** 96. Degrees of (higher) grades from Him, and Forgiveness and Mercy. And All�h is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**97.** 97. Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): "In what (condition) were you?" They reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the earth." They (angels) say: "Was not the earth of All�h spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination![1]

**98.** 98. Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way.

**99.** 99. These are they whom All�h is likely to forgive them, and All�h is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.

**100.** 100. He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of All�h, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto All�h and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon All�h. And All�h is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**101.** 101. And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten As-Sal�t (the prayer) if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you etc.), verily, the disbelievers are ever unto you open enemies.

**102.** 102. When you (O Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) are among them, and lead them in As-Sal�t (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Sal�t (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you taking all the precautions and bearing arms. Those who disbelieve wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to attack you in a single rush, but there is no sin on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take every precaution for yourselves. Verily, All�h has prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers.[1]

**103.** 103. When you have finished As-Sal�t (the congregational prayer), remember All�h standing, sitting down, and (lying down) on your sides, but when you are free from danger, perform As-Sal�t (Iqamat-as-Sal�t). Verily, As-Sal�t (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.

**104.** 104. And don�t be weak in the pursuit of the enemy; if you are suffering (hardships) then surely, they (too) are suffering (hardships) as you are suffering, but you have a hope from All�h (for the reward, i.e. Paradise) that for which they hope not; and All�h is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**105.** 105. Surely, We have sent down to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) the Book (this Qur��n) in truth that you might judge between men by that which All�h has shown you (i.e. has taught you through Divine Revelation), so be not a pleader for the treacherous.

**106.** 106. And seek the Forgiveness of All�h,[1] certainly, All�h is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**107.** 107. And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, All�h does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner.

**108.** 108. They may hide (their crimes) from men, but they cannot hide (them) from All�h; for He is with them (by His Knowledge), when they plot by night in words that He does not approve. And All�h ever encompasses what they do.

**109.** 109. Lo! You are those who have argued for them in the life of this world, but who will argue for them on the Day of Resurrection against All�h, or who will then be their defender?

**110.** 110. And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks All�h�s Forgiveness, he will find All�h Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**111.** 111. And whoever earns sin, he earns it only against himself. And All�h is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**112.** 112. And whoever earns a fault or a sin and then throws it on to someone innocent, he has indeed burdened himself with falsehood and a manifest sin.

**113.** 113. Had not the Grace of All�h and His Mercy been upon you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), a party of them would certainly have made a decision to mislead you, but (in fact) they mislead none except their own selves, and no harm can they do to you in the least. All�h has sent down to you the Book (The Qur��n), and Al-Hikmah (Isl�mic laws, knowledge of legal and illegal things i.e. the Prophet�s Sunnah - legal ways), and taught you that which you knew not. And Ever Great is the Grace of All�h unto you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????).

**114.** 114. There is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in All�h�s Cause), or Ma�r�f (Isl�mic Monotheism and all the good and righteous deeds which All�h has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, seeking the good Pleasure of All�h, We shall give him a great reward.

**115.** 115. And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers� way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination![1]

**116.** 116. Verily! All�h forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with All�h, has indeed strayed far away.

**117.** 117. They (all those who worship others than All�h) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (All�h), and they invoke nothing but Shait�n (Satan), a persistent rebel!

**118.** 118. All�h cursed him. And he [Shait�n (Satan)] said: "I will take an appointed portion of your slaves.

**119.** 119. Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by All�h." And whoever takes Shait�n (Satan) as a Wal� (protector or helper) instead of All�h, has surely suffered a manifest loss.[2]

**120.** 120. He [Shait�n (Satan)] makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shait�n�s (Sat�n) promises are nothing but deceptions.

**121.** 121. The dwelling of such (people) is Hell, and they will find no way of escape from it.

**122.** 122. But those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e. in Paradise) to dwell therein forever. All�h�s Promise is the Truth; and whose words can be truer than those of All�h? (Of course, none).

**123.** 123. It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides All�h.

**124.** 124. And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a (true) believer [in the Oneness of All�h (Muslim)], such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a speck on the back of a date-stone, will be done to them.

**125.** 125. And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to All�h (i.e. follows All�h�s religion of Isl�mic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer - See V.2:112). And follows the religion of Ibr�h�m[1](Abraham) Han�fa (Isl�mic Monotheism - to worship none but All�h Alone). And All�h did take Ibr�h�m (Abraham) as a Khal�l (an intimate friend)!

**126.** 126. And to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And All�h is Ever Encompassing all things.

**127.** 127. They ask your legal instruction concerning women, say: All�h instructs you about them, and about what is recited unto you in the Book concerning the orphan girls whom you give not the prescribed portions (as regards Mahr and inheritance) and yet whom you desire to marry, and (concerning) the children who are weak and oppressed, and that you stand firm for justice to orphans. And whatever good you do, All�h is Ever All-Aware of it.

**128.** 128. And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband�s part, there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better. And human inner-selves are swayed by greed. But if you do good and keep away from evil, verily, All�h is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do.

**129.** 129. You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not incline too much to one of them (by giving her more of your time and provision) so as to leave the other hanging (i.e. neither divorced nor married). And if you do justice, and do all that is right and fear All�h by keeping away from all that is wrong, then All�h is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**130.** 130. But if they separate (by divorce), All�h will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And All�h is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures� need, All-Wise.

**131.** 131. And to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And verily, We have recommended to the people of the Scripture before you, and to you (O Muslims) that you (all) fear All�h, and keep your duty to Him. But if you disbelieve, then unto All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and All�h is Ever Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise.

**132.** 132. And to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And All�h is Ever All-Sufficient as Disposer of affairs.

**133.** 133. If He wills, He can take you away, O people, and bring others. And All�h is Ever All-Potent over that.

**134.** 134. Whoever desires a reward in this life of the world, then with All�h (Alone and none else) is the reward of this worldly life and of the Hereafter. And All�h is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer.

**135.** 135. O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to All�h, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, be he rich or poor, All�h is a Better Protector to both (than you). So follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you avoid justice; and if you distort your witness or refuse to give it, verily, All�h is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do.[1]

**136.** 136. O you who believe! Believe in All�h, and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and the Book (the Qur��n) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in All�h, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.

**137.** 137. Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; All�h will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (Right) Way.

**138.** 138. Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful torment.[2]

**139.** 139. Those who take disbelievers for Auliy� (protectors or helpers or friends) instead of believers, do they seek honour, power and glory with them? Verily, then to All�h belongs all honour, power and glory.

**140.** 140. And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur��n) that when you hear the Verses of All�h being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, All�h will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.

**141.** 141. Those (hypocrites) who wait and watch about you; if you gain a victory from All�h, they say: "Were we not with you?" But if the disbelievers gain a success, they say (to them): "Did we not gain mastery over you and did we not protect you from the believers?" All�h will judge between you (all) on the Day of Resurrection. And never will All�h grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.

**142.** 142. Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive All�h, but it is He Who deceives them.[1] And when they stand up for As-Sal�t (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember All�h but little.

**143.** 143. (They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom All�h sends astray, you will not find for him a way (to the truth - Isl�m).

**144.** 144. O you who believe! Take not for Auliy� (protectors or helpers or friends) disbelievers instead of believers. Do you wish to offer All�h a manifest proof against yourselves?

**145.** 145. Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.[2]

**146.** 146. Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to All�h, and purify their religion for All�h (by worshipping none but All�h, and do good for All�h�s sake only, not to show off), then they will be with the believers. And All�h will grant the believers a great reward.

**147.** 147. Why should All�h punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him. And All�h is Ever All-Appreciative (of good), All-Knowing.

**148.** 148. All�h does not like that the evil should be uttered in public except by him who has been wronged. And All�h is Ever All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**149.** 149. Whether you (mankind) disclose (by good words of thanks) a good deed (done to you in the form of a favour by someone), or conceal it, or pardon an evil, ... verily, All�h is Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.

**150.** 150. Verily, those who disbelieve in All�h and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between All�h and His Messengers (by believing in All�h and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, "We believe in some but reject others," and wish to adopt a way in between.

**151.** 151. They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.

**152.** 152. And those who believe in All�h and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and All�h is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**153.** 153. The people of the Scripture (Jews) ask you to cause a book to descend upon them from heaven. Indeed they asked M�s� (Moses) for even greater than that, when they said: "Show us All�h in public," but they were struck with thunderclap and lightning for their wickedness. Then they worshipped the calf even after clear proofs, evidence, and signs had come to them. (Even) so We forgave them. And We gave M�s� (Moses) a clear proof of authority.

**154.** 154. And for their covenant, We raised over them the Mount and (on the other occasion) We said: "Enter the gate prostrating (or bowing) with humility;" and We commanded them: "Transgress not (by doing worldly works) on the Sabbath (Saturday)." And We took from them a firm covenant[1].

**155.** 155. Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying: "Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers say)" - nay, All�h has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little.

**156.** 156. And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary ?????? ??????) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse);

**157.** 157. And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed Messiah ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of All�h," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ��s� (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) ?????? ??????]:

**158.** 158. But All�h raised him [��s� (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he ???? ?????? is in the heavens). And All�h is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.

**159.** 159. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of All�h and a human being][1] before his [��s� (Jesus) ???? ??????) or a Jew�s or a Christian�s] death[2] (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [��s� (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.

**160.** 160. For the wrong-doing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them - and for their hindering many from All�h�s Way;

**161.** 161. And their taking of Rib� (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it and their devouring of men�s substance wrongfully (bribery). And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful torment.

**162.** 162. But those among them who are well-grounded in knowledge, and the believers, believe in what has been sent down to you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and what was sent down before you; and those who perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t ), and give Zak�t and believe in All�h and in the Last Day, it is they to whom We shall give a great reward.

**163.** 163. Verily, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)[1] as We sent the revelation to N�h (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the revelation to Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ism��l (Ishmael), Ish�q (Isaac), Ya�q�b (Jacob), and Al-Asb�t [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya�q�b (Jacob)], ��s� (Jesus), Ayy�b (Job), Y�nus (Jonah), H�r�n (Aaron), and Sulaim�n (Solomon); and to D�w�d (David) We gave the Zab�r (Psalms).

**164.** 164. And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you, - and to M�s� (Moses) All�h spoke directly.

**165.** 165. Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against All�h after the (coming of) Messengers. And All�h is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.

**166.** 166. But All�h bears witness to that which He has sent down (the Qur��n) unto you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????); He has sent it down with His Knowledge, and the angels bear witness. And All�h is All-Sufficient as a Witness.

**167.** 167. Verily, those who disbelieve [by concealing the truth about Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and his message of true Isl�mic Monotheism written in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) with them] and prevent (mankind) from the Path of All�h (Isl�mic Monotheism); they have certainly strayed far away. (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�).

**168.** 168. Verily, those who disbelieve and did wrong [by concealing the truth about Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and his message of true Isl�mic Monotheism written in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) with them]; All�h will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way - (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�).

**169.** 169. Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein forever; and this is ever easy for All�h.[2]

**170.** 170. O mankind! Verily, there has come to you the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with the truth from your Lord. So believe in him, it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, then certainly to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And All�h is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**171.** 171. O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of All�h aught but the truth. The Messiah ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of All�h and His Word, ("Be!" - and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (R�h )[1] created by Him; so believe in All�h and His Messengers. Say not: "Three (trinity)!" Cease! (it is) better for you. For All�h is (the only) One Il�h (God), glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And All�h is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.[2]

**172.** 172. The Messiah will never be proud to reject to be a slave to All�h, nor the angels who are the near (to All�h). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.

**173.** 173. So, as for those who believed (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and did deeds of righteousness, He will give them their (due) rewards - and more out of His Bounty. But as for those who refused His worship and were proud, He will punish them with a painful torment. And they will not find for themselves besides All�h any protector or helper.

**174.** 174. O mankind! Verily, there has come to you a convincing proof (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from your Lord; and We sent down to you a manifest light (this Qur��n).

**175.** 175. So, as for those who believed in All�h and held fast to Him, He will admit them to His Mercy and Grace (i.e. Paradise), and guide them to Himself by the Straight Path.

**176.** 176. They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: "All�h directs (thus) about Al-Kal�lah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs). If it is a man that dies leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the share of the female. (Thus) does All�h make clear to you (His Law) lest you go astray. And All�h is the All-Knower of everything."
