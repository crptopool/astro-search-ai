# Surah 89: The Dawn (Al-Fajr)

**1.** 1. By the dawn;

**2.** 2. By the ten nights (i.e. the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah)[1],

**3.** 3. And by the even and the odd (of all the creations of All�h).[2]

**4.** 4. And by the night when it departs.

**5.** 5. There is indeed in them (the above oaths) sufficient proofs for men of understanding (and that, they should avoid all kinds of sins and disbeliefs)!

**6.** 6. Saw you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) not how your Lord dealt with ��d (people)

**7.** 7. Of Iram (who were very tall) like (lofty) pillars,

**8.** 8. The like of which were not created in the land?

**9.** 9. And (with) Tham�d (people), who hewed out rocks in the valley (to make dwellings)? [3]

**10.** 10. And (with) Fir�aun (Pharaoh) who had the stakes (to torture men by binding them to the stakes)?

**11.** 11. Who did transgress beyond bounds in the lands (in the disobedience of All�h).

**12.** 12. And made therein much mischief.

**13.** 13. So your Lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment.

**14.** 14. Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful (over them).

**15.** 15. As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honour and bounties, then he says (in exultation): "My Lord has honoured me."

**16.** 16. But when He tries him by straitening his means of life, he says: "My Lord has humiliated me!"

**17.** 17. Nay! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity (i.e. you neither treat them well, nor give them their exact right of inheritance)!

**18.** 18. And urge not one another on the feeding of Al-Misk�n (the poor)!

**19.** 19. And you devour the inheritance all with greed.

**20.** 20. And you love wealth with much love.

**21.** 21. Nay! When the earth is ground to powder.

**22.** 22. And your Lord comes with the angels in rows.

**23.** 23. And Hell will be brought near that Day. On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him?

**24.** 24. He will say: "Alas! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my life!"

**25.** 25. So on that Day none will punish as He will punish.

**26.** 26. And none will bind (the wicked, disbelievers and polytheists) as He will bind.

**27.** 27. (It will be said to the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism): "O (you) the one in (complete) rest and satisfaction!

**28.** 28. "Come back to your Lord well-pleased (yourself) and well-pleasing (unto Him)!

**29.** 29. "Enter you then among My (honoured) slaves,

**30.** 30. "And enter you My Paradise!"
