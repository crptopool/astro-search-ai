# Surah 9: The Repentance (At-Tawbah)

**1.** 1. Freedom from (all) obligations (is declared) from All�h and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????) to those of the Mushrik�n (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h), with whom you made a treaty.

**2.** 2. So travel freely (O Mushrik�n - See V.2:105) for four months (as you will) throughout the land, but know that you cannot escape (from the punishment of) All�h; and All�h will disgrace the disbelievers.

**3.** 3. And a declaration from All�h and His Messenger to mankind on the greatest day (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah - the 12th month of Isl�mic calendar) that All�h is free from (all) obligations to the Mushrik�n (See V.2:105) and so is His Messenger. So if you (Mushrik�n ) repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape (from the Punishment of) All�h. And give tidings (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) of a painful torment to those who disbelieve.

**4.** 4. Except those of the Mushrik�n (see V.2:105) with whom you have a treaty, and who have not subsequently failed you in aught, nor have supported anyone against you. So fulfil their treaty to them for the end of their term. Surely All�h loves Al-Mattaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**5.** 5. Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Isl�mic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrik�n (See V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent and perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t, then leave their way free. Verily, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[1]

**6.** 6. And if anyone of the Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h) seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Word of All�h (the Qur��n), and then escort him to where he can be secure, that is because they are men who know not.

**7.** 7. How can there be a covenant with All�h and with His Messenger for the Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h) except those with whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjid-al-Har�m (at Makkah)? So long as they are true to you, stand you true to them. Verily, All�h loves Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**8.** 8. How (can there be such a covenant with them) that when you are overpowered by them, they regard not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant with you? With (good words from) their mouths they please you, but their hearts are averse to you, and most of them are F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**9.** 9. They have purchased with the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h a little gain, and they hindered men from His Way; evil indeed is that which they used to do.

**10.** 10. With regard to a believer, they respect not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant! It is they who are the transgressors.

**11.** 11. But if they repent, perform As-Sal�t, (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t) and give Zak�t,[1] then they are your brethren in religion. (In this way) We explain the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail for a people who know.

**12.** 12. But if they violate their oaths after their covenant, and attack your religion with disapproval and criticism, then fight (you) the leaders of disbelief (chiefs of Quraish pagans of Makkah) - for surely their oaths are nothing to them - so that they may stop (evil actions).

**13.** 13. Will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths (pagans of Makkah), and intended to expel the Messenger while they did attack you first? Do you fear them? All�h has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers.

**14.** 14. Fight against them so that All�h will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people,

**15.** 15. And remove the anger of their (believers�) hearts. All�h accepts the repentance of whom He wills. All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**16.** 16. Do you think that you shall be left alone while All�h has not yet tested those among you who have striven hard and fought and have not taken Wal�jah [(Bit�nah - helpers, advisors and consultants from disbelievers, pagans.) giving openly to them their secrets] besides All�h, and His Messenger, and the believers. All�h is Well-Acquainted with what you do.

**17.** 17. It is not for the Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h), to maintain the Mosques of All�h (i.e. to pray and worship All�h therein, to look after their cleanliness and their building,), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.

**18.** 18. The Mosques of All�h shall be maintained only by those who believe in All�h and the Last Day, perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t and fear none but All�h. It is they who are on true guidance.

**19.** 19. Do you consider the providing of drinking water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of Al-Masjidal-Har�m (at Makkah) as equal to the worth of those who believe in All�h and the Last Day, and strive hard and fight in the Cause of All�h? They are not equal before All�h. And All�h guides not those people who are the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**20.** 20. Those who believed (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and emigrated and strove hard and fought in All�h�s Cause with their wealth and their lives are far higher in degree with All�h. They are the successful.[1]

**21.** 21. Their Lord gives them glad tidings of Mercy from Him, and His being pleased (with them), and of Gardens (Paradise) for them wherein are everlasting delights.

**22.** 22. They will dwell therein forever. Verily, with All�h is a great reward.

**23.** 23. O you who believe! Take not as Auliy� (supporters and helpers) your fathers and your brothers if they prefer disbelief to Belief. And whoever of you does so, then he is one of the Z�lim�n (wrong-doers).

**24.** 24. Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than All�h and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His Cause,[1] then wait until All�h brings about His Decision (torment). And All�h guides not the people who are Al-F�siq�n (the rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**25.** 25. Truly All�h has given you victory on many battle fields, and on the Day of Hunain (battle) when you rejoiced at your great number, but it availed you naught and the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for you, then you turned back in flight.

**26.** 26. Then All�h did send down His Sak�nah (calmness, tranquillity and reassurance) on the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and on the believers, and sent down forces (angels) which you saw not, and punished the disbelievers. Such is the recompense of disbelievers.

**27.** 27. Then after that All�h will accept the repentance of whom He wills. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**28.** 28. O you who believe (in All�h�s Oneness and in His Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)! Verily, the Mushrik�n (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h, and in the Message of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) are Najasun (impure).[1] So let them not come near Al-Masjidal-Har�m (at Makkah) after this year; and if you fear poverty, All�h will enrich you if He wills, out of His Bounty. Surely, All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**29.** 29. Fight against those who (1) believe not in All�h, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by All�h and His Messenger Muhammad (??? ???? ???? ????) (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Isl�m) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah [2] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.

**30.** 30. And the Jews say: �Uzair (Ezra) is the son of All�h, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of All�h. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. All�h�s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth![3]

**31.** 31. They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides All�h (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by All�h), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Il�h (God - All�h) L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)[4]. Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)."

**32.** 32. They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish All�h�s Light (with which Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? has been sent - Isl�mic Monotheism) with their mouths, but All�h will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the K�fir�n (disbelievers) hate (it).

**33.** 33. It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with guidance and the religion of truth (Isl�m), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrik�n (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h) hate (it).

**34.** 34. O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks who devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the Way of All�h (i.e. All�h�s religion of Isl�mic Monotheism). And those who hoard up gold and silver [Al-Kanz: the money, the Zak�t of which has not been paid] and spend them not in the Way of All�h, announce unto them a painful torment.

**35.** 35. On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver the Zak�t of which has not been paid) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them): "This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard."[1]

**36.** 36. Verily, the number of months with All�h is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by All�h on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred (i.e. the 1st, the 7th, the 11th and the 12th months of the Isl�mic calendar). That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein, and fight against the Mushrik�n (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h) collectively[2] as they fight against you collectively. But know that All�h is with those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**37.** 37. The postponing (of a Sacred Month) is indeed an addition to disbelief: thereby the disbelievers are led astray, for they make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by All�h, and make such forbidden ones lawful. The evil of their deeds is made fair-seeming to them. And All�h guides not the people who disbelieve.

**38.** 38. O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of All�h (i.e. Jih�d) you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared to the Hereafter.[1]

**39.** 39. If you march not forth, He will punish you with a painful torment and will replace you by another people; and you cannot harm Him at all, and All�h is Able to do all things.

**40.** 40. If you help him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) not (it does not matter), for All�h did indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two; when they (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and Abu Bakr ??? ???? ???) were in the cave, he (??? ???? ???? ????) said to his companion (Abu Bakr ??? ???? ???): "Be not sad (or afraid), surely All�h is with us." Then All�h sent down His Sak�nah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of All�h that became the uppermost; and All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

**41.** 41. March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of All�h. This is better for you, if you but knew.

**42.** 42. Had it been a near gain (booty in front of them) and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the distance (Tabuk expedition) was long for them; and they would swear by All�h, "If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you." They destroy their ownselves, and All�h knows that they are liars.

**43.** 43. May All�h forgive you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). Why did you grant them leave (for remaining behind; you should have persisted as regards your order to them to proceed on Jih�d ), until those who told the truth were seen by you in a clear light, and you had known the liars?

**44.** 44. Those who believe in All�h and the Last Day would not ask your leave to be exempted from fighting with their properties and their lives; and All�h is the All-Knower of Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**45.** 45. It is only those who believe not in All�h and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave (to be exempted from Jih�d). So in their doubts they waver.

**46.** 46. And if they had intended to march out, certainly, they would have made some preparation for it; but All�h was averse to their being sent forth, so He made them lag behind, and it was said (to them), "Sit you among those who sit (at home)."

**47.** 47. Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst (spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you - and there are some among you who would have listened to them. And All�h is the All-Knower of the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**48.** 48. Verily, they had plotted sedition before, and had upset matters for you, until the truth (victory) came and the Decree of All�h (His religion, Isl�m) became manifest though they hated it.

**49.** 49. And among them is he who says: "Grant me leave (to be exempted from Jih�d) and put me not into trial." Surely, they have fallen into trial. And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.

**50.** 50. If good befalls you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), it grieves them, but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: "We took our precaution beforehand" and they turn away rejoicing.

**51.** 51. Say: "Nothing shall ever happen to us except what All�h has ordained for us.[1] He is our Maul� (Lord, Helper and Protector)." And in All�h let the believers put their trust.

**52.** 52. Say: "Do you wait for us (anything) except one of the two best things (martyrdom or victory); while we await for you either that All�h will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait, we too are waiting with you."

**53.** 53. Say: "Spend (in All�h�s Cause) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Verily, you are ever a people who are F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h)."

**54.** 54. And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in All�h and in His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and that they came not to As-Sal�t (the prayer) except in a lazy state,[2] and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly.

**55.** 55. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????); in reality All�h�s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.

**56.** 56. They swear by All�h that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are a people (hypocrites) who are afraid (that you may kill them).

**57.** 57. Should they find a refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto with a swift rush.

**58.** 58. And of them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms. If they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if they are not given thereof, behold! They are enraged![1]

**59.** 59. Would that they were contented with what All�h and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????) gave them and had said: "All�h is Sufficient for us. All�h will give us of His Bounty, and so will His Messenger (from alms). We implore All�h (to enrich us)."

**60.** 60. As-Sadaq�t (here it means Zak�t ) are only for the Fuqar� (poor), and Al-Mas�kin [2] (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds), and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Isl�m), and to free the captives, and for those in debt, and for All�h�s Cause (i.e. for Mujahid�n - those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by All�h. And All�h is All-Knower, All-Wise.

**61.** 61. And among them are men who annoy the Prophet (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and say: "He is (lending his) ear (to every news)." Say: "He listens to what is best for you; he believes in All�h, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy to those of you who believe." But those who annoy All�h�s Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) will have a painful torment. [See V.33:57]

**62.** 62. They swear by All�h to you (Muslims) in order to please you, but it is more fitting that they should please All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), if they are believers.

**63.** 63. Know they not that whoever opposes and shows hostility to All�h (?? ???) and His Messenger(??? ???? ???? ????), certainly for him will be the Fire of Hell to abide therein. That is the extreme disgrace.

**64.** 64. The hypocrites fear lest a S�rah (chapter of the Qur��n) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: "(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly All�h will bring to light all that you fear."

**65.** 65. If you ask them (about this), they declare: "We were only talking idly and joking." Say: "Was it at All�h (?? ???), and His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????) that you were mocking?"

**66.** 66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they were Mujrim�n (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals.).

**67.** 67. The hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Isl�m has forbidden), and forbid (people) from Al-Ma�r�f (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and all that Isl�m orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in All�h�s Cause) alms]. They have forgotten All�h, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**68.** 68. All�h has promised the hypocrites - men and women - and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell; therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. All�h has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment.

**69.** 69. Like those before you: they were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in wealth and children. They had enjoyed their portion (awhile), so enjoy your portion (awhile) as those before you enjoyed their portion (awhile); and you indulged in play and pastime (and in telling lies against All�h and His Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as they indulged in play and pastime. Such are they whose deeds are in vain in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers.

**70.** 70. Has not the story reached them of those before them? - The people of N�h (Noah), ��d, and Tham�d, the people of Ibr�h�m (Abraham), the dwellers of Madyan (Midian) and the cities overthrown [i.e. the people to whom L�t (Lot) preached]; to them came their Messengers with clear proofs. So it was not All�h Who wronged them, but they used to wrong themselves.

**71.** 71. The believers, men and women, are Auliy� (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma�r�f (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and all that Isl�m orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Isl�m has forbidden); they perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give the Zak�t, and obey All�h and His Messenger. All�h will have His Mercy on them. Surely All�h is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

**72.** 72. All�h has promised the believers - men and women, - Gardens under which rivers flow to dwell therein forever, and beautiful mansions in Gardens of �Adn (Eden Paradise). But the greatest bliss is the Good Pleasure of All�h. That is the supreme success.

**73.** 73. O Prophet (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh against them, their abode is Hell, - and worst indeed is that destination.

**74.** 74. They swear by All�h that they said nothing (bad), but really they said the word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after accepting Isl�m, and they resolved that (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) which they were unable to carry out, and they could not find any cause to do so except that All�h and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If then they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, All�h will punish them with a painful torment in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. And there is none for them on earth as a Wal� (supporter, protector) or a helper.

**75.** 75. And of them are some who made a covenant with All�h (saying): "If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily give Sadaq�h (Zak�t and voluntary charity in All�h�s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous."

**76.** 76. Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaq�h (Zak�t or voluntary charity)], and turned away, averse.

**77.** 77. So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with All�h) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies.

**78.** 78. Know they not that All�h knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa [1] (secret counsels), and that All�h is the All-Knower of things unseen.

**79.** 79. Those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in All�h�s Cause) voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity (in All�h�s Cause) except what is available to them - so they mock at them (believers); All�h will throw back their mockery on them, and they shall have a painful torment.

**80.** 80. Whether you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or ask not forgiveness for them - (and even) if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness - All�h will not forgive them because they have disbelieved in All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). And All�h guides not those people who are F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**81.** 81. Those who stayed away (from Tabuk expedition) rejoiced in their staying behind the Messenger of All�h; they hated to strive and fight with their properties and their lives in the Cause of All�h, and they said: "March not forth in the heat." Say: "The Fire of Hell is more intense in heat"; if only they could understand!

**82.** 82. So let them laugh a little and (they will) cry much as a recompense of what they used to earn (by committing sins).

**83.** 83. If All�h brings you back to a party of them (the hypocrites), and they ask your permission to go out (to fight), say: "Never shall you go out with me nor fight an enemy with me; you were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion, then you sit (now) with those who lag behind."

**84.** 84. And never (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in All�h and His Messenger, and died while they were F�siq�n (rebellious, - disobedient to All�h and His Messenger ??? ???? ???? ????).

**85.** 85. And let not their wealth or their children amaze you. All�h�s Plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while they are disbelievers.

**86.** 86. And when a S�rah (chapter from the Qur��n) is revealed, enjoining them to believe in All�h and to strive hard and fight along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them ask your leave to exempt them (from Jih�d) and say, "Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home)."

**87.** 87. They are content to be with those (the women) who sit behind (at home). Their hearts are sealed up (from all kinds of goodness and right guidance), so they understand not.

**88.** 88. But the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and those who believed with him (in Isl�mic Monotheism) strove hard and fought with their wealth and their lives (in All�h�s Cause). Such are they for whom are the good things, and it is they who will be successful.

**89.** 89. For them All�h has got ready Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.

**90.** 90. And those who made excuses from the bedouins came (to you, O Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????) asking your permission to exempt them (from the battle), and those who had lied to All�h and His Messenger sat at home (without asking the permission for it); a painful torment will seize those of them who disbelieve.

**91.** 91. There is no blame on those who are weak or ill or who find no resources to spend [in holy fighting (Jih�d)], if they are sincere and true (in duty) to All�h and His Messenger.[1] No ground (of complaint) can there be against the Muhsin�n (good-doers - See the footnote of V.9:120). And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**92.** 92. Nor (is there blame) on those who came to you to be provided with mounts, when you said: "I can find no mounts for you," they turned back, while their eyes overflowing with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend (for Jih�d).

**93.** 93. The ground (of complaint) is only against those who are rich, and yet ask exemption.[2] They are content to be with (the women) who sit behind (at home) and All�h has sealed up their hearts (from all kinds of goodness and right guidance) so that they know not (what they are losing).

**94.** 94. They (the hypocrites) will present their excuses to you (Muslims), when you return to them. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) "Present no excuses, we shall not believe you. All�h has already informed us of the news concerning you. All�h and His Messenger will observe your deeds. In the end you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He (All�h) will inform you of what you used to do." [Tafsir At-Tabari]

**95.** 95. They will swear by All�h to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijs [i.e. Najas (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place - a recompense for that which they used to earn.

**96.** 96. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly All�h is not pleased with the people who are Al-F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**97.** 97. The bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely to be in ignorance of the limits (All�h�s Commandments and His Laws) which All�h has revealed to His Messenger. And All�h is All-Knower, All-Wise.

**98.** 98. And of the bedouins there are some who look upon what they spend (in All�h�s Cause) as a fine and watch for calamities for you, on them be the calamity of evil. And All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**99.** 99. And of the bedouins there are some who believe in All�h and the Last Day, and look upon what they spend in All�h�s Cause as means of nearness to All�h, and a cause of receiving the Messenger�s invocations. Indeed these (spendings in All�h�s Cause) are a means of nearness for them. All�h will admit them to His Mercy. Certainly All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**100.** 100. And the foremost to embrace Isl�m of the Muh�jir�n (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the Ans�r (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the Muh�jir�n ) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). All�h is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.

**101.** 101. And among the bedouins around you, some are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Al-Madinah who persist in hypocrisy; you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) know them not, We know them. We shall punish them twice, and thereafter they shall be brought back to a great (horrible) torment.

**102.** 102. And (there are) others who have acknowledged their sins, they have mixed a deed that was righteous with another that was evil. Perhaps All�h will turn unto them in forgiveness. Surely, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[1]

**103.** 103. Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke All�h for them. Verily! Your invocations are a source of security for them; and All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**104.** 104. Know they not that All�h accepts repentance from His slaves and takes the Sadaq�t (alms, charity), and that All�h Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?

**105.** 105. And say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) "Do deeds! All�h will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. And you will be brought back to the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you used to do."

**106.** 106. And others are made to await for All�h�s Decree, whether He will punish them or will forgive them. And All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**107.** 107. And as for those who put up a mosque by way of harm and disbelief and to disunite the believers and as an outpost for those who warred against All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) aforetime, they will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good. All�h bears witness that they are certainly liars.

**108.** 108. Never stand you therein. Verily, the mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray). In it are men who love to clean and to purify themselves. And All�h loves those who make themselves clean and pure [i.e. who clean their private parts with dust (which has the properties of soap) and water from urine and stools, after answering the call of nature].

**109.** 109. Is it then he who laid the foundation of his building on piety to All�h and His Good Pleasure better, or he who laid the foundation of his building on the brink of an undetermined precipice ready to crumble down, so that it crumbled to pieces with him into the Fire of Hell. And All�h guides not the people who are the Z�lim�n (cruel, violent, proud, polytheist and wrong-doer).

**110.** 110. The building which they built will never cease to be a cause of hypocrisy and doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are cut to pieces. (i.e. till they die). And All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**111.** 111. Verily, All�h has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs shall be the Paradise. They fight in All�h�s Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Qur��n. And who is truer to his covenant than All�h? Then rejoice in the bargain which you have concluded. That is the supreme success.[1]

**112.** 112. (The believers whose lives All�h has purchased are) those who turn to All�h in repentance (from polytheism and hypocrisy, etc.), who worship (Him), who praise (Him), who fast (or go out in All�h�s Cause), who bow down (in prayer), who prostrate themselves (in prayer), who enjoin (on people) Al-Ma�r�f (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and all what Isl�m has ordained) and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds and all that Isl�m has forbidden), and who observe the limits set by All�h (do all that All�h has ordained and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which All�h has forbidden). And give glad tidings to the believers.[1]

**113.** 113. It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask All�h�s Forgiveness for the Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h), even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).

**114.** 114. And Ibr�h�m�s (Abraham) invoking (of All�h) for his father�s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibr�h�m (Abraham)] had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him [Ibr�h�m (Abraham)] that he (his father) is an enemy of All�h, he dissociated himself from him. Verily Ibr�h�m (Abraham) was Awwah (one who invokes All�h with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much) and was forbearing. (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�)[2].

**115.** 115. And All�h will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid. Verily, All�h is the All-Knower of everything.[3]

**116.** 116. Verily, All�h! Unto Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, He gives life and He causes death. And besides All�h you have neither any Wal� (protector or guardian) nor any helper.

**117.** 117. All�h has forgiven the Prophet (??? ???? ???? ????), the Muh�jir�n (Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ans�r (Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in the time of distress (Tab�k expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful.

**118.** 118. And (He did forgive also) the three [who did not join the Tab�k expedition whose case was deferred (by the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????)] (for All�h�s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from All�h, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His pardon [repent (unto Him)] Verily, All�h is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.

**119.** 119. O you who believe! Be afraid of All�h, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).[1]

**120.** 120. It was not becoming of the people of Al-Madinah and the bedouins of the neighbourhood to remain behind All�h�s Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? when fighting in All�h�s Cause) and (it was not becoming of them) to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of All�h, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, All�h wastes not the reward of the Muhsin�n [2]

**121.** 121. Nor do they spend anything (in All�h�s Cause) - small or great - nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit that All�h may recompense them with the best of what they used to do (i.e. All�h will reward their good deeds according to the reward of their best deeds which they did in the most perfect manner).[3]

**122.** 122. And it is not (proper) for the believers to go out to fight (Jih�d ) all together. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Isl�mic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).

**123.** 123. O you who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are close to you, and let them find harshness in you; and know that All�h is with those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**124.** 124. And whenever there comes down a S�rah (chapter from the Qur��n), some of them (hypocrites) say: "Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?" As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.

**125.** 125. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers.

**126.** 126. See they not that they are put in trial once or twice every year (with different kinds of calamities, disease, famine)? Yet, they turn not in repentance, nor do they learn a lesson (from it).

**127.** 127. And whenever there comes down a S�rah (chapter from the Qur��n), they look at one another (saying): "Does any one see you?" Then they turn away. All�h has turned their hearts (from the light) because they are a people that understand not.

**128.** 128. Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is anxious over you (to be rightly guided, to repent to All�h, and beg Him to pardon and forgive your sins in order that you may enter Paradise and be saved from the punishment of the Hell-fire); for the believers (he ??? ???? ???? ???? is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.

**129.** 129. But if they turn away, say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "All�h is sufficient for me. L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne."[1]
