# Surah 96: The Clot (Al-'Alaq)

**1.** 1. Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists).

**2.** 2. He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).

**3.** 3. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.

**4.** 4. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen.

**5.** 5. He has taught man that which he knew not.

**6.** 6. Nay! Verily, man does transgress (in disbelief and evil deed).

**7.** 7. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.

**8.** 8. Surely, unto your Lord is the return.

**9.** 9. Have you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) seen him (i.e. Ab� Jahl) who prevents

**10.** 10. A slave (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) when he prays?

**11.** 11. Tell me if he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is on the guidance (of All�h)

**12.** 12. Or enjoins piety!

**13.** 13. Tell me if he (Ab� Jahl) denies (the truth, i.e. this Qur��n) and turns away?

**14.** 14. Knows he not that All�h does see (what he does)?

**15.** 15. Nay! If he (Ab� Jahl) ceases not, We will catch him by the forelock -

**16.** 16. A lying, sinful forelock!

**17.** 17. Then let him call upon his council (of helpers).

**18.** 18. We will call out the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!

**19.** 19. Nay! (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)! Do not obey him (Ab� Jahl). Fall prostrate and draw near to All�h!
