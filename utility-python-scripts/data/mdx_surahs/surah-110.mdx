# Surah 110: The Divine Support (An-Nasr)

**1.** 1. When there comes the Help of All�h (to you, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah).

**2.** 2. And you see that the people enter Allah�s religion (Isl�m) in crowds.

**3.** 3. So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His Forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.
