# Surah 57: The Iron (Al-Hadid)

**1.** 1. Whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies All�h - and He is the All-Mighty, All-Wise.

**2.** 2. His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who gives life and causes death: and He is Able to do all things.

**3.** 3. He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.

**4.** 4. He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days and then rose over (Istaw�) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be. And All�h is the All-Seer of what you do.

**5.** 5. His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And to All�h return all the matters (for decision).

**6.** 6. He merges night into day (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the night is added into the hours of the day), and merges day into night (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the day is added into the hours of the night), and He has full knowledge of whatsoever is in the breasts.

**7.** 7. Believe in All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees.[1] And such of you as believe and spend (in All�h�s Way), theirs will be a great reward.

**8.** 8. And what is the matter with you that you believe not in All�h! While the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) invites you to believe in your Lord (All�h); and He (All�h) has indeed taken your covenant, if you are real believers.

**9.** 9. It is He Who sends down manifest Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to His slave (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, All�h is to you full of kindness, Most Merciful.

**10.** 10. And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the Cause of All�h? And to All�h belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the conquering (of Makkah, with those among you who did so later). Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all All�h has promised the best (reward). And All�h is All-Aware of what you do.

**11.** 11. Who is he that will lend All�h a goodly loan: then (All�h) will increase it manifold to his credit (in repaying), and he will have (besides) a good reward (i.e. Paradise).

**12.** 12. On the Day you shall see the believing men and the believing women: their light running forward before them and by their right hands. Glad tidings for you this Day! Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever! Truly, this is the great success!

**13.** 13. On the Day when the hypocrites - men and women - will say to the believers: "Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!" It will be said: "Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!" So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment."

**14.** 14. (The hypocrites) will call the believers: "Were we not with you?" The believers will reply: "Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted (in Faith) and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of All�h came to pass. And the chief deceiver (Satan) deceived you in respect of All�h."

**15.** 15. So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites), nor of those who disbelieved, (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism). Your abode is the Fire. That is your maul� (friend - proper place), and worst indeed is that destination.

**16.** 16. Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) to be affected by All�h�s Reminder (this Qur��n), and that which has been revealed of the truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture [the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] before (i.e. Jews and Christians), and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them were F�siq�n (the rebellious, the disobedient to All�h).

**17.** 17. Know that All�h gives life to the earth after its death! Indeed We have made clear the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to you, if you but understand.

**18.** 18. Verily, those who give Sadaq�t (i.e. Zak�t and alms), men and women, and lend All�h a goodly loan, it shall be increased manifold (to their credit), and theirs shall be an honourable good reward (i.e. Paradise).

**19.** 19. And those who believe in (the Oneness of) All�h and His Messengers - they are the Siddiq�n (i.e. those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them), and the martyrs with their Lord, they shall have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and deny Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) - they shall be the dwellers of the blazing Fire.

**20.** 20. Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children. (It is) as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers - evil-doers), and (there is) Forgiveness from All�h and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers - good-doers). And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.

**21.** 21. Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (All�h), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in All�h and His Messengers. That is the Grace of All�h which He bestows on whom He is pleased with. And All�h is the Owner of Great Bounty.

**22.** 22. No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahf�z) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for All�h.[1]

**23.** 23. In order that you may not grieve at the things that you fail to get, nor rejoice over that which has been given to you. And All�h likes not prideful boasters.

**24.** 24. Those who are misers and enjoin upon people miserliness - (All�h is not in need of their charity). And whosoever turns away (from Faith - All�h�s Monotheism), then All�h is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.

**25.** 25. Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice. And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war[1]), as well as many benefits for mankind, that All�h may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen. Verily, All�h is All-Strong, All-Mighty.

**26.** 26. And indeed, We sent N�h (Noah) and Ibr�h�m (Abraham), and placed in their offspring Prophethood and Scripture. And among them there are some who are guided; but many of them are F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**27.** 27. Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent ��s� (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), and gave him the Injeel (Gospel). And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy. But the monasticism which they invented for themselves, We did not prescribe for them, but (they sought it) only to please All�h therewith, but they did not observe it with the right observance. So We gave those among them who believed their (due) reward; but many of them are F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**28.** 28. O you who believe [in M�s� (Moses) (i.e. Jews) and ��s� (Jesus) (i.e. Christians)]! Fear All�h, and believe in His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), He will give you a double portion of His Mercy, and He will give you a light by which you shall walk (straight). And He will forgive you. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.[2]

**29.** 29. So that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may know that they have no power whatsoever over the Grace of All�h, and that (His) Grace is (entirely) in His Hand to bestow it on whomsoever He wills. And All�h is the Owner of Great Bounty.
