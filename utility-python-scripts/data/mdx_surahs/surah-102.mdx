# Surah 102: The Rivalry in world increase (At-Takathur)

**1.** 1. The mutual rivalry (for piling up of worldly things) diverts you,

**2.** 2. Until you visit the graves (i.e. till you die).

**3.** 3. Nay! You shall come to know!

**4.** 4. Again nay! You shall come to know!

**5.** 5. Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have been occupied yourselves in worldly things).

**6.** 6. Verily, You shall see the blazing Fire (Hell)!

**7.** 7. And again, you shall see it with certainty of sight!

**8.** 8. Then on that Day you shall be asked about the delights[2] (you indulged in, in this world)!
