# Surah 81: The Overthrowing (At-Takwir)

**1.** 1. When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown.[1]

**2.** 2. And when the stars fall.

**3.** 3. And when the mountains are made to pass away;

**4.** 4. And when the pregnant she-camels are neglected;

**5.** 5. And when the wild beasts are gathered together.

**6.** 6. And when the seas become as blazing Fire or overflow.

**7.** 7. And when the souls are joined with their bodies, (the good with the good and the bad with the bad).

**8.** 8. And when the female (infant) buried alive (as the pagan Arabs used to do) is questioned:[2]

**9.** 9. For what sin, was she killed?

**10.** 10. And when the (written) pages [of deeds (good and bad) of every person] are laid open.

**11.** 11. And when the heaven is stripped off and taken away from its place;

**12.** 12. And when Hell-fire is set ablaze.

**13.** 13. And when Paradise is brought near.

**14.** 14. (Then) every person will know what he has brought (of good and evil).

**15.** 15. So verily, I swear by the planets that recede (i.e. disappear during the day and appear during the night).

**16.** 16. And by the planets that move swiftly and hide themselves.

**17.** 17. And by the night as it departs.

**18.** 18. And by the dawn as it brightens.

**19.** 19. Verily, this is the Word (this Qur��n brought by) a most honourable messenger [Jibr�l (Gabr�l), from All�h to Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????].

**20.** 20. Owner of power, (and high rank) with (All�h), the Lord of the Throne,

**21.** 21. Obeyed (by the angels in the heavens), and trustworthy.

**22.** 22. And (O people) your companion (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is not a madman.

**23.** 23. And indeed he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) saw him [Jibr�l (Gabriel)] in the clear horizon (towards the east).

**24.** 24. And he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen.

**25.** 25. And it (the Qur��n) is not the word of the outcast Shait�n (Satan).

**26.** 26. Then where are you going?

**27.** 27. Verily, this (the Qur��n) is no less than a Reminder to (all) the ��lam�n (mankind and jinn)[3]

**28.** 28. To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.

**29.** 29. And you cannot will unless (it be) that All�h wills - the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
