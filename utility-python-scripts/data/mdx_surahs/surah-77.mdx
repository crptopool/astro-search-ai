# Surah 77: The Emissaries (Al-Mursalat)

**1.** 1. By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of All�h) sent forth one after another.

**2.** 2. And by the winds that blow violently.

**3.** 3. And by the winds that scatter clouds and rain.

**4.** 4. And by the Verses (of the Qur��n) that separate the right from the wrong.

**5.** 5. And by the angels that bring the revelations to the Messengers,

**6.** 6. To cut off all excuses or to warn.

**7.** 7. Surely, what you are promised must come to pass.

**8.** 8. Then when the stars lose their lights.

**9.** 9. And when the heaven is cleft asunder.

**10.** 10. And when the mountains are blown away.

**11.** 11. And when the Messengers are gathered to their time appointed.

**12.** 12. For what Day are these signs postponed?

**13.** 13. For the Day of Sorting Out (the men of Paradise from the men destined for Hell).

**14.** 14. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out?

**15.** 15. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**16.** 16. Did We not destroy the ancients?

**17.** 17. So shall We make later generations to follow them.

**18.** 18. Thus do We deal with the Mujrim�n (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals).

**19.** 19. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**20.** 20. Did We not create you from a despised water (semen)?

**21.** 21. Then We placed it in a place of safety (womb),

**22.** 22. For a known period (determined by gestation)?

**23.** 23. So We did measure; and We are the Best to measure (the things).

**24.** 24. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**25.** 25. Have We not made the earth a receptacle

**26.** 26. For the living and the dead?

**27.** 27. And have placed therein firm, and tall mountains, and have given you to drink sweet water?

**28.** 28. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**29.** 29. (It will be said to the disbelievers): "Depart you to that which you used to deny!

**30.** 30. "Depart you to a shadow (of Hell-Fire smoke ascending) in three columns,

**31.** 31. Neither shady, nor of any use against the fierce flame of the Fire."

**32.** 32. Verily, it (Hell) throws sparks (huge) as Al-Qasr (a fort or a huge log of wood),

**33.** 33. As if they were yellow camels or bundles of ropes.

**34.** 34. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**35.** 35. That will be a Day when they shall not speak (during some part of it),

**36.** 36. And they will not be permitted to put forth any excuse.

**37.** 37. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**38.** 38. That will be a Day of Decision! We have brought you and the men of old together!

**39.** 39. So if you have a plot, use it against Me (All�h ?? ?????)!

**40.** 40. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**41.** 41. Verily, the Muttaq�n (the pious. See V.2:2) shall be amidst shades and springs.

**42.** 42. And fruits, such as they desire.

**43.** 43. "Eat and drink comfortably for that which you used to do."

**44.** 44. Verily, thus We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers. See V.2:112).

**45.** 45. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**46.** 46. (O you disbelievers)! Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the Mujrim�n (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals).

**47.** 47. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**48.** 48. And when it is said to them: "Bow down yourself (in prayer)!" They bow not down (offer not their prayers).[1]

**49.** 49. Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!

**50.** 50. Then in what statement after this (the Qur��n) will they believe?
