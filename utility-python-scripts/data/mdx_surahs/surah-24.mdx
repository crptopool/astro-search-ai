# Surah 24: The Light (An-Nur)

**1.** 1. (This is) a S�rah (chapter of the Qur��n) which We have sent down and which We have enjoined, (ordained its laws); and in it We have revealed manifest Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations - lawful and unlawful things, and set boundaries of Isl�mic Religion), that you may remember.

**2.** 2. The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by All�h, if you believe in All�h and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment. (This punishment is for unmarried persons guilty of the above crime, but if married persons commit it (illegal sex), the punishment is to stone them to death, according to All�h�s Law).[1]

**3.** 3. The adulterer-fornicator marries not but an adulteress-fornicatress or a Mushrikah, and the adulteress-fornicatress none marries her except an adulterer-fornicator or a Muskrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is either an adulterer-fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer-fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Isl�mic Monotheism).

**4.** 4. And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the F�siq�n (liars, rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**5.** 5. Except those who repent thereafter and do righteous deeds; (for such) verily, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**6.** 6. And for those who accuse their wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e. testifies four times) by All�h that he is one of those who speak the truth.

**7.** 7. And the fifth (testimony should be) the invoking of the Curse of All�h on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her).

**8.** 8. But it shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, if she bears witness four times by All�h, that he (her husband) is telling a lie.

**9.** 9. And the fifth (testimony) should be that the Wrath of All�h be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth.

**10.** 10. And had it not been for the Grace of All�h and His Mercy on you (He would have hastened the punishment upon you)! And that All�h is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, the All-Wise.

**11.** 11. Verily those who brought forth the slander (against ��ishah ??? ???? ???? the wife of the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????) are a group among you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.

**12.** 12. Why then, did not the believers, men and women, when you heard it (the slander), think good of their own people and say: "This (charge) is an obvious lie[1]?"

**13.** 13. Why did they not produce four witnesses? Since they (the slanderers) have not produced witnesses! Then with All�h they are the liars.

**14.** 14. Had it not been for the Grace of All�h and His Mercy unto you in this world and in the Hereafter, a great torment would have touched you for that whereof you had spoken.

**15.** 15. When you were propagating it with your tongues, and uttering with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge, you counted it a little thing, while with All�h it was very great.

**16.** 16. And why did you not, when you heard it, say: "It is not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You (O All�h)! This is a great lie."

**17.** 17. All�h forbids you from it and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.

**18.** 18. And All�h makes the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) plain to you, and All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**19.** 19. Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And All�h knows and you know not.

**20.** 20. And had it not been for the Grace of All�h and His Mercy on you, (All�h would have hastened the punishment upon you). And that All�h is full of Kindness, Most Merciful.

**21.** 21. O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shait�n (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shait�n (Satan), then, verily he commands Al-Fahsh� [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Isl�m)]. And had it not been for the Grace of All�h and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But All�h purifies (guides to Isl�m) whom He wills, and All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**22.** 22. And let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, Al-Mas�k�n (the poor), and those who left their homes for All�h�s Cause. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that All�h should forgive you? And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**23.** 23. Verily, those who accuse chaste women, who never even think of anything touching their chastity and are good believers - are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter, and for them will be a great torment -

**24.** 24. On the Day when their tongues, their hands, and their legs (or feet) will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.

**25.** 25. On that Day All�h will pay them the recompense of their deeds in full, and they will know that All�h, He is the Manifest Truth.

**26.** 26. Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women): such (good people) are innocent of (every) bad statement which they say; for them is Forgiveness, and Rizqun Kar�m (generous provision i.e. Paradise).

**27.** 27. O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them; that is better for you, in order that you may remember.

**28.** 28. And if you find no one therein, still, enter not until permission has been given. And if you are asked to go back, go back, for it is purer for you. And All�h is All-Knower of what you do.

**29.** 29. There is no sin on you that you enter (without taking permission) houses uninhabited (i.e. not possessed by anybody), (when) you have any interest in them. And All�h has knowledge of what you reveal and what you conceal.

**30.** 30. Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, All�h is All-Aware of what they do.

**31.** 31. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over Juy�bihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband�s fathers, or their sons, or their husband�s sons, or their brothers or their brother�s sons, or their sister�s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Isl�m), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg All�h to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.[1]

**32.** 32. And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the S�lih�n (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, All�h will enrich them out of His Bounty. And All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people).

**33.** 33. And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until All�h enriches them of His Bounty. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them. And give them something (yourselves) out of the wealth of All�h which He has bestowed upon you. And force not your maids to prostitution, if they desire chastity, in order that you may make a gain in the (perishable) goods of this worldly life. But if anyone compels them (to prostitution), then after such compulsion, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (to those women, i.e. He will forgive them because they have been forced to do this evil act unwillingly).

**34.** 34. And indeed We have sent down for you Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that make things plain, and the example of those who passed away before you, and an admonition for those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**35.** 35. All�h is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp: the lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! All�h guides to His Light whom He wills. And All�h sets forth parables for mankind, and All�h is All-Knower of everything.

**36.** 36. In houses (mosques) which All�h has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhan, Iqamah, Sal�t (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur��n etc.]. Therein glorify Him (Allah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,[1]

**37.** 37. Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the Remembrance of All�h (with heart and tongue), nor from performing As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), nor from giving the Zak�t. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).

**38.** 38. That All�h may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And All�h provides without measure to whom He wills.[1]

**39.** 39. As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to it, he finds it to be nothing; but he finds All�h with him, Who will pay him his due (Hell). And All�h is Swift in taking account.[2]

**40.** 40. Or [the state of a disbeliever] is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with waves topped by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom All�h has not appointed light, for him there is no light.

**41.** 41. See you not (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) that All�h, He it is Whom glorify whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, and the birds with wings out-spread (in their flight)?. Of each one He (All�h) knows indeed his Sal�t (prayer) and his glorification, [or everyone knows his Sal�t (prayer) and his glorification]; and All�h is All-Aware of what they do.

**42.** 42. And to All�h belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to All�h is the return (of all).

**43.** 43. See you not that All�h drives the clouds gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain comes forth from between them; and He sends down from the sky hail (like) mountains, (or there are in the heaven mountains of hail from where He sends down hail), and strikes therewith whom He wills, and averts it from whom He wills. The vivid flash of its (clouds) lightning nearly blinds the sight. [Tafsir At-Tabar�].

**44.** 44. All�h causes the night and the day to succeed each other (i.e. if the day is gone, the night comes, and if the night is gone, the day comes, and so on). Truly, in this is indeed a lesson for those who have insight.

**45.** 45. All�h has created every moving (living) creature from water. Of them there are some that creep on their bellies, and some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. All�h creates what He wills. Verily All�h is Able to do all things.

**46.** 46. We have indeed sent down (in this Qur��n) manifest Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, lawful and unlawful things, and the set boundaries of Isl�mic religion, etc. that make things clear showing the Right Path of All�h). And All�h guides whom He wills to the Straight Path (i.e. to All�h�s religion of Isl�mic Monotheism).

**47.** 47. They (hypocrites) say: "We have believed in All�h and in the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), and we obey," then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers.

**48.** 48. And when they are called to All�h (i.e. His Words, the Qur��n) and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????), to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuses (to come) and turns away.

**49.** 49. But if the truth is on their side, they come to him willingly with submission.

**50.** 50. Is there a disease in their hearts? Or do they doubt or fear lest All�h and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????) should wrong them in judgement. Nay, it is they themselves who are the Z�lim�n (polytheists, hypocrites and wrong-doers).

**51.** 51. The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to All�h (His Words, the Qur��n) and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????), to judge between them, is that they say: "We hear and we obey." And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).

**52.** 52. And whosoever obeys All�h and His Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????), fears All�h, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful.

**53.** 53. They swear by All�h their strongest oaths, that if only you would order them, they would leave (their homes for fighting in All�h�s Cause). Say: "Swear you not; (this) obedience (of yours) is known (to be false). Verily, All�h knows well what you do."

**54.** 54. Say: "Obey All�h and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey All�h�s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messenger�s duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way)."

**55.** 55. All�h has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Isl�m). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**56.** 56. And perform As-Sal�t (Iq�mat-as-Sal�t), and give Zak�t and obey the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) that you may receive mercy (from All�h).

**57.** 57. Consider not that the disbelievers can escape in the land. Their abode shall be the Fire - and worst indeed is that destination.

**58.** 58. O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before Fajr (morning) Sal�t (prayer), and while you put off your clothes for the noonday (rest), and after the �Ish� (late-night) Sal�t (prayer). (These) three times are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus All�h makes clear the Ay�t (the Verses of this Qur��n, showing proofs for the legal aspects of permission for visits) to you. And All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**59.** 59. And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age). Thus All�h makes clear His Ay�t (Commandments and legal obligations) for you. And All�h is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

**60.** 60. And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**61.** 61. There is no restriction on the blind, nor any restriction on the lame, nor any restriction on the sick, nor on yourselves, if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your father�s brothers, or the houses of your father�s sisters, or the houses of your mother�s brothers, or the houses of your mother�s sisters, or (from that) whereof you hold keys, or (from the house) of a friend. No sin on you whether you eat together or apart. But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from All�h (i.e. say: ?????? ?????) As-Sal�mu �Alaikum - peace be on you) blessed and good. Thus All�h makes clear the Ay�t (these Verses or your religious symbols and signs) to you that you may understand.

**62.** 62. The true believers are only those, who believe in (the Oneness of) All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): and when they are with him on some common matter, they go not away until they have asked his permission. Verily those who ask your permission, those are they who (really) believe in All�h and His Messenger. So if they ask your permission for some affairs of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them, and ask All�h for their forgiveness. Truly, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**63.** 63. Make not the calling of the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) among you as your calling one of another. All�h knows those of you who slip away under shelter (of some excuse without taking the permission to leave, from the Messenger (??? ???? ???? ????). And let those who oppose the Messenger�s (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah - legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.

**64.** 64. Certainly, to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Surely, He knows your condition and (He knows) the Day when they will be brought back to Him, then He will inform them of what they did. And All�h is All-Knower of everything.
