# Surah 82: The Cleaving (Al-Infitar)

**1.** 1. When the heaven is cleft asunder.

**2.** 2. And when the stars have fallen and scattered.

**3.** 3. And when the seas are burst forth.

**4.** 4. And when the graves are turned upside down (and bring out their contents)

**5.** 5. (Then) a person will know what he has sent forward and (what he has) left behind (of good or bad deeds).

**6.** 6. O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous?

**7.** 7. Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion.

**8.** 8. In whatever form He willed, He put you together.

**9.** 9. Nay! But you deny Ad-D�n (i.e. the Day of Recompense).

**10.** 10. But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,[1]

**11.** 11. Kir�man (Honourable) K�tib�n writing down (your deeds),[2]

**12.** 12. They know all that you do.

**13.** 13. Verily, the Abr�r (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism) will be in Delight (Paradise);

**14.** 14. And verily, the Fujj�r (the wicked, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners and evil-doers) will be in the blazing Fire (Hell),

**15.** 15. Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense,

**16.** 16. And they (Al-Fujj�r) will not be absent therefrom.

**17.** 17. And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?

**18.** 18. Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?

**19.** 19. (It will be) the Day when no person shall have power (to do) anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be (wholly) with All�h.
