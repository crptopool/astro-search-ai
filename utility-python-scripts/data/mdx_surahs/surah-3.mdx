# Surah 3: Family of Imran (Ali 'Imran)

**1.** 1. Alif-L�m-M�m. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur��n, and none but All�h (Alone) knows their meanings].

**2.** 2. All�h! L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists).

**3.** 3. It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur��n) to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel),

**4.** 4. Aforetime, as a guidance to mankind. And He sent down the criterion [of judgement between right and wrong (this Qur��n)]. Truly, those who disbelieve in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h, for them there is a severe torment; and All�h is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.

**5.** 5. Truly, nothing is hidden from All�h, in the earth or in the heaven.

**6.** 6. He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**7.** 7. It is He Who has sent down to you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) the Book (this Qur��n). In it are Verses that are entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book [and those are the Verses of Al-Ahk�m (commandments), Al-Fara�id (obligatory duties) and Al-Hudud (legal laws for the punishment of thieves, adulterers)]; and others not entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings, but none knows its hidden meanings save All�h. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: "We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord." And none receive admonition except men of understanding. (Tafsir At-Tabar�).

**8.** 8. (They say): "Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower."

**9.** 9. "Our Lord! Verily, it is You Who will gather mankind together on the Day about which there is no doubt. Verily, All�h never breaks His Promise".

**10.** 10. Verily, those who disbelieve, neither their properties nor their offspring will avail them whatsoever against All�h; and it is they who will be fuel of the Fire.

**11.** 11. Like the behaviour of the people of Fir�aun (Pharaoh) and those before them; they belied Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). So All�h seized (destroyed) them for their sins. And All�h is Severe in punishment.

**12.** 12. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) to those who disbelieve: "You will be defeated and gathered together to Hell, and worst indeed is that place to rest."

**13.** 13. There has already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat i.e. the battle of Badr). One was fighting in the Cause of All�h, and as for the other, (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them (the disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were thrice their number). And All�h supports with His Victory whom He wills. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand. (See Verse 8:44). (Tafsir At-Tabar�)

**14.** 14. Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world�s life; but All�h has the excellent return (Paradise with flowing rivers) with Him.

**15.** 15. Say: "Shall I inform you of things far better than those? For Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azw�jun Mutahharatun [1] (purified mates or wives). And All�h will be pleased with them. And All�h is All-Seer of the (His) slaves".

**16.** 16. Those who say: "Our Lord! We have indeed believed, so forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the Fire."

**17.** 17. (They are) those who are patient, those who are true (in Faith, words, and deeds), and obedient with sincere devotion in worship to All�h. Those who spend [give the Zak�t and alms in the Way of All�h] and those who pray and beg All�h�s Pardon in the last hours of the night.

**18.** 18. All�h bears witness that L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in Justice. L� il�ha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**19.** 19. Truly, the religion with All�h is Isl�m. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h, then surely, All�h is Swift in calling to account.

**20.** 20. So if they dispute with you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) say: "I have submitted myself to All�h (in Isl�m), and (so have) those who follow me." And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): "Do you (also) submit yourselves (to All�h in Isl�m)?" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and All�h is All-Seer of (His) slaves[1].

**21.** 21. Verily! Those who disbelieve in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h and kill the Prophets without right, and kill those men who order just dealings, ... then announce to them a painful torment.

**22.** 22. They are those whose works will be lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.

**23.** 23. Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the Scripture? They are being invited to the Book of All�h to settle their dispute, then a party of them turn away, and they are averse.

**24.** 24. This is because they say: "The Fire shall not touch us but for a number of days." And that which they used to invent regarding their religion has deceived them.

**25.** 25. How (will it be) when We gather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt (i.e. the Day of Resurrection). And each person will be paid in full what he has earned? And they will not be dealt with unjustly.

**26.** 26. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "O All�h! Possessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You will, and You take the kingdom from whom You will, and You endue with honour whom You will, and You humiliate whom You will. In Your Hand[1] is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all things.

**27.** 27. You make the night to enter into the day, and You make the day to enter into the night (i.e. increase and decrease in the hours of the night and the day during winter and summer), You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living. And You give wealth and sustenance to whom You will, without limit (measure or account).

**28.** 28. Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Auliy� (supporters, helpers) instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by All�h in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And All�h warns you against Himself (His punishment)[2], and to All�h is the final return.

**29.** 29. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, All�h knows it, and He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. And All�h is Able to do all things."

**30.** 30. On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And All�h warns you against Himself (His punishment) and All�h is full of kindness to (His) slaves.

**31.** 31. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? to mankind): "If you (really) love All�h then follow me (i.e. accept Isl�mic Monotheism, follow the Qur��n and the Sunnah), All�h will love you and forgive you your sins. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

**32.** 32. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Obey All�h and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)." But if they turn away, then All�h does not like the disbelievers[1].

**33.** 33. All�h chose Adam, N�h (Noah), the family of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) and the family of �Imr�n above the ��lam�n (mankind and jinn) (of their times).

**34.** 34. Offspring, one of the other, and All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**35.** 35. (Remember) when the wife of �Imr�n said: "O my Lord! I have vowed to You what (the child that) is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services (free from all worldly work; to serve Your Place of worship), so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing."

**36.** 36. Then when she gave birth to her [child Maryam (Mary)], she said: "O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child," - and All�h knew better what she brought forth, - "And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam[2] (Mary), and I seek refuge with You (All�h) for her and for her offspring from Shait�n (Satan), the outcast."

**37.** 37. So her Lord (All�h) accepted her with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariy� (Zachariya). Every time he entered Al-Mihr�b [3] to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said: "O Maryam (Mary)! From where have you got this?" She said, "This is from All�h." Verily, All�h provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit."

**38.** 38. At that time Zakariy� (Zachariya) invoked his Lord, saying: "O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation."

**39.** 39. Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in Al-Mihr�b (a praying place or a private room), (saying): "All�h gives you glad tidings of Yahya (John), confirming (believing in) the word from All�h [i.e. the creation of ��s� (Jesus) ???? ??????, the Word from All�h ("Be!" - and he was!)], noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous."

**40.** 40. He said: "O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old, and my wife is barren?" (All�h) said: "Thus All�h does what He wills."

**41.** 41. He said: "O my Lord! Make a sign for me." All�h said: "Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.[1]"

**42.** 42. And (remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, All�h has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the ��lam�n (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime)."

**43.** 43. O Mary! "Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (All�h, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and Irk�i (bow down) along with Ar-R�ki��n (those who bow down)."

**44.** 44. This is a part of the news of the Ghaib (unseen, i.e. the news of the past nations of which you have no knowledge) which We reveal to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam (Mary); nor were you with them when they disputed.

**45.** 45. (Remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, All�h gives you the glad tidings of a Word ["Be!" - and he was! i.e. ��s� (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ��s� (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to All�h."

**46.** 46. "He will speak to the people in the cradle[1] and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous."

**47.** 47. She said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me." He said: "So (it will be) for All�h creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: "Be!" - and it is.

**48.** 48. And He (All�h) will teach him [(��s� (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the faultless speech of the Prophets, wisdom), (and) the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).

**49.** 49. And will make him [(��s� (Jesus)] a Messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by All�h�s Leave; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I bring the dead to life by All�h�s Leave. And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses. Surely, therein is a sign for you, if you believe.

**50.** 50. And I have come confirming that which was before me of the Taur�t (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. So fear All�h and obey me.

**51.** 51. Truly! All�h is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the Straight Path.

**52.** 52. Then when ��s� (Jesus) came to know of their disbelief, he said: "Who will be my helpers in All�h�s Cause?" Al-Haw�riyy�n (the disciples) said: "We are the helpers of All�h; we believe in All�h, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to All�h)."

**53.** 53. Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger [(��s� (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth i.e. L� il�ha illall�h - none has the right to be worshipped but All�h).

**54.** 54. And they (disbelievers) plotted to kill ��s� [(Jesus) ???? ??????], and All�h plotted too. And All�h is the Best of those who plot.

**55.** 55. And (remember) when All�h said: "O ��s� (Jesus)! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you [of the forged statement that ��s� (Jesus) is All�h�s son] of those who disbelieve, and I will make those who follow you (Monotheists, who worship none but All�h) superior to those who disbelieve [in the Oneness of All�h, or disbelieve in some of His Messengers, e.g. Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, ��s� (Jesus), M�s� (Moses), etc., or in His Holy Books, e.g. the Taur�t (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), the Qur��n] till the Day of Resurrection[1]. Then you will return to Me and I will judge between you in the matters in which you used to dispute."

**56.** 56. "As to those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe torment in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers."

**57.** 57. And as for those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h) and do righteous good deeds, All�h will pay them their reward in full. And All�h does not like the Z�limun (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**58.** 58. This is what We recite to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) of the Verses and the Wise Reminder (i.e. the Qur��n).

**59.** 59. Verily, the likeness of ��s� (Jesus) before All�h is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: "Be!" - and he was.

**60.** 60. (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of those who doubt.

**61.** 61. Then whoever disputes with you concerning him [��s� (Jesus)] after (all this) knowledge that has come to you [i.e. ��s� (Jesus) being a slave of All�h, and having no share in Divinity], say: (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) "Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke (sincerely) the Curse of All�h upon those who lie."

**62.** 62. Verily! This is the true narrative [about the story of ��s� (Jesus)], and L� il�ha illall�h (none has the right to be worshipped but All�h, the One and the Only True God, Who has neither a wife nor a son). And indeed, All�h is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**63.** 63. And if they turn away (and do not accept these true proofs and evidence), then surely, All�h is All-Aware of those who do mischief.

**64.** 64. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but All�h (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides All�h[1]. Then, if they turn away, say: "Bear witness that we are Muslims."

**65.** 65. O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibr�h�m (Abraham), while the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) were not revealed till after him? Have you then no sense?

**66.** 66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge? It is All�h Who knows, and you know not.

**67.** 67. Ibr�h�m (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Han�fa (Isl�mic Monotheism - to worship none but All�h Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrik�n (See V.2:105)[2].

**68.** 68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibr�h�m (Abraham) are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and those who have believed (Muslims). And All�h is the Wal� (Protector and Helper) of the believers.

**69.** 69. A party of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish to lead you astray. But they shall not lead astray anyone except themselves, and they perceive not.

**70.** 70. O people of the Scripture! (Jews and Christians): "Why do you disbelieve in the Ay�t of All�h, [the Verses about Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? present in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] while you (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth)."

**71.** 71. O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): "Why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know?"[1]

**72.** 72. And a party of the people of the Scripture say: "Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the believers (Muslims), and reject it at the end of the day, so that they may turn back.

**73.** 73. And believe no one except the one who follows your religion. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Verily! Right guidance is the Guidance of All�h" and do not believe that anyone can receive like that which you have received, otherwise they would engage you in argument before your Lord. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "All the bounty is in the Hand[2] of All�h; He grants to whom He wills. And All�h is All-Sufficient for His creatures� needs, All-Knower."

**74.** 74. He selects for His Mercy (Isl�m and the Qur��n with Prophethood) whom He wills and All�h is the Owner of Great Bounty.

**75.** 75. Among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is he who, if entrusted with a Qint�r (a great amount of wealth, etc.), will readily pay it back; and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because they say: "There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs)." But they tell a lie against All�h while they know it.

**76.** 76. Yes, whoever fulfils his pledge and fears All�h much; verily, then All�h loves those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**77.** 77. Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of All�h�s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will All�h speak to them, nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.

**78.** 78. And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: "This is from All�h," but it is not from All�h; and they speak a lie against All�h while they know it.

**79.** 79. It is not (possible) for any human being to whom All�h has given the Book and Al-Hukm (the knowledge and understanding of the laws of religion) and Prophethood to say to the people: "Be my worshippers rather than All�h�s." On the contrary (he would say): "Be you Rabb�niyy�n (learned men of religion who practise what they know and also preach others), because you are teaching the Book, and you are studying it."

**80.** 80. Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods)[1]. Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to All�h�s Will? (Tafsir At-Tabar�).

**81.** 81. And (remember) when All�h took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: "Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of All�h), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him." All�h said: "Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this)."

**82.** 82. Then whoever turns away after this, they are the F�siq�n (rebellious: those who turn away from All�h�s Obedience).

**83.** 83. Do they seek other than the religion of All�h (the true Isl�mic Monotheism - worshipping none but All�h Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.

**84.** 84. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "We believe in All�h and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibr�h�m (Abraham), Ism��l (Ishmael), Ish�q (Isaac), Ya�q�b (Jacob) and Al-Asb�t [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya�q�b (Jacob)] and what was given to M�s� (Moses), ��s� (Jesus) and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between one another among them and to Him (All�h) we have submitted (in Isl�m)."

**85.** 85. And whoever seeks a religion other than Isl�m, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers[1].

**86.** 86. How shall All�h guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) is true and after clear proofs had come unto them? And All�h guides not the people who are Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**87.** 87. They are those whose recompense is that on them (rests) the Curse of All�h, of the angels, and of all mankind.

**88.** 88. They will abide therein (Hell). Neither will their torment be lightened, nor will it be delayed or postponed (for a while).

**89.** 89. Except for those who repent after that and do righteous deeds. Verily, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**90.** 90. Verily, those who disbelieved after their Belief and then went on increasing in their disbelief (i.e. disbelief in the Qur��n and in Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) - never will their repentance be accepted [because they repent only by their tongues and not from their hearts]. And they are those who are astray.

**91.** 91. Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom[2]. For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.

**92.** 92. By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness - here it means All�h�s Reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in All�h�s Cause) of that which you love; and whatever of good you spend, All�h knows it well.

**93.** 93. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Israel made unlawful for himself before the Taur�t (Torah) was revealed. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Bring here the Taur�t (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful."

**94.** 94. Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against All�h, ... such shall indeed be the Z�lim�n (disbelievers).

**95.** 95. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "All�h has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) Han�fa (Isl�mic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship All�h Alone), and he was not of Al-Mushrik�n " (See V.2:105)

**96.** 96. Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-��lam�n (mankind and jinn).

**97.** 97. In it are manifest signs (for example), the Maq�m (place) of Ibr�h�m (Abraham); whosoever enters it, he attains security. And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka�bah ) is a duty that mankind owes to All�h, those who can afford the expenses (for one�s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of All�h], then All�h stands not in need of any of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists)[1].

**98.** 98. Say: "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you reject the Ay�t of All�h (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) while All�h is Witness to what you do?"

**99.** 99. Say: "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you stop those who have believed, from the Path of All�h, seeking to make it seem crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses [to Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? as a Messenger of All�h and Isl�m (All�h�s religion, i.e. to worship none but Him Alone)]? And All�h is not unaware of what you do."

**100.** 100. O you who believe! If you obey a group of those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians), they would (indeed) render you disbelievers after you have believed!

**101.** 101. And how would you disbelieve, while unto you are recited the Verses of All�h, and among you is His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)? And whoever holds firmly to All�h, (i.e. follows Isl�m - All�h�s Religion, and obeys all that All�h has ordered, practically), then he is indeed guided to the Right Path.

**102.** 102. O you who believe! Fear All�h (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared. [Obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always], and die not except in a state of Isl�m [as Muslims (with complete submission to All�h)].

**103.** 103. And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of All�h (i.e. this Qur��n), and be not divided among yourselves[1], and remember All�h�s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Isl�mic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus All�h makes His Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided.

**104.** 104. Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Isl�m), enjoining Al-Ma�r�f (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and all that Isl�m orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Isl�m has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.

**105.** 105. And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment.

**106.** 106. On the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) when some faces will become white and some faces will become black; as for those whose faces will become black (to them will be said): "Did you reject Faith after accepting it? Then taste the torment (in Hell) for rejecting Faith."

**107.** 107. And for those whose faces will become white, they will be in All�h�s Mercy (Paradise), therein they shall dwell forever.

**108.** 108. These are the Verses of All�h: We recite them to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) in truth, and All�h wills no injustice to the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**109.** 109. And to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And all matters go back (for decision) to All�h.

**110.** 110. You [true believers in Isl�mic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma�r�f (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and all that Isl�m has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Isl�m has forbidden), and you believe in All�h[1]. And had the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) believed, it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith, but most of them are Al-F�siq�n (disobedient to All�h - and rebellious against All�h�s Command).

**111.** 111. They will do you no harm, barring a trifling annoyance; and if they fight against you, they will show you their backs, and they will not be helped.

**112.** 112. Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from All�h, and from men; they have drawn on themselves the Wrath of All�h, and destruction is put over them. This is because they disbelieved in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h and killed the Prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed (All�h) and used to transgress beyond bounds (in All�h�s disobedience, crimes and sins).

**113.** 113. Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of All�h during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer.

**114.** 114. They believe in All�h and the Last Day; they enjoin Al-Ma�r�f (Isl�mic Monotheism, and following Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and opposing Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????); and they hasten in (all) good works; and they are among the righteous.

**115.** 115. And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for All�h knows well those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**116.** 116. Surely, those who reject Faith (disbelieve in All�h and in Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) as being All�h�s Messenger and in all that which he ??? ???? ???? ???? has brought from All�h), neither their properties, nor their offspring will avail them aught against All�h. They are the dwellers of the Fire, therein they will abide.[1] (Tafsir At-Tabar�).

**117.** 117. The likeness of what they spend in this world is the likeness of a wind which is extremely cold; it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it, (i.e. the good deed of a person is only accepted if he is a monotheist and believes in all the Prophets of All�h, including the Christ ???? ?????? and Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). All�h wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.

**118.** 118. O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bit�nah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand.

**119.** 119. Lo! You are the ones who love them but they love you not, and you believe in all the Scriptures [i.e. you believe in the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), while they disbelieve in your Book, the Qur��n]. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe." But when they are alone, they bite the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: "Perish in your rage. Certainly, All�h knows what is in the breasts (all the secrets)."

**120.** 120. If a good befalls you, it grieves them, but if some evil overtakes you, they rejoice at it. But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaq�n [the pious - See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, All�h surrounds all that they do.

**121.** 121. And (remember) when you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle (of Uhud). And All�h is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

**122.** 122. When two parties from among you were about to lose heart, but All�h was their Wal� (Supporter and Protector). And in All�h should the believers put their trust.

**123.** 123. And All�h has already made you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force. So fear All�h much[1] that you may be grateful.

**124.** 124. (Remember) when you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Lord (All�h) should help you with three thousand angels sent down?"

**125.** 125. "Yes, if you hold on to patience and piety, and the enemy comes rushing at you; your Lord will help you with five thousand angels having marks (of distinction)."

**126.** 126. All�h made it not but as a message of good news for you and as an assurance to your hearts. And there is no victory except from All�h, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**127.** 127. That He might cut off a part of those who disbelieve, or expose them to infamy, so that they retire frustrated.

**128.** 128. Not for you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????, but for All�h) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Z�lim�n (polytheists, disobedients, and wrong-doers).

**129.** 129. And to All�h belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills. And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**130.** 130. O you who believe! Eat not Rib� (usury)[2] doubled and multiplied, but fear All�h that you may be successful.

**131.** 131. And fear the Fire, which is prepared for the disbelievers.

**132.** 132. And obey All�h and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) that you may obtain mercy.[3]

**133.** 133. And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**134.** 134. Those who spend (in All�h�s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity[1], who repress anger[2], and who pardon men; verily, All�h loves Al-Muhsin�n [3] (the good-doers).

**135.** 135. And those who, when they have committed F�hishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember All�h and ask forgiveness for their sins; - and none can forgive sins but All�h - and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.[4]

**136.** 136. For such, the reward is Forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to All�h�s Orders).

**137.** 137. Many similar ways (and mishaps of life) were faced by nations (believers and disbelievers) that have passed away before you (as you have faced in the battle of Uhud), so travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of All�h, and disobeyed Him and His Messengers).

**138.** 138. This (the Qur��n) is a plain statement for mankind, a guidance and instruction to those who are Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**139.** 139. So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) believers.

**140.** 140. If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), We give to men by turns, that All�h may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And All�h likes not the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**141.** 141. And that All�h may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers.

**142.** 142. Do you think that you will enter Paradise before All�h tests those of you who fought (in His Cause) and (also) tests those who are As-S�bir�n (the patient)?

**143.** 143. You did indeed wish for death (Ash-Shah�dah - martyrdom) before you met it. Now you have seen it openly with your own eyes.

**144.** 144. Muhammad (??? ???? ???? ????) is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to All�h; and All�h will give reward to those who are grateful.

**145.** 145. And no person can ever die except by All�h�s Leave and at an appointed term. And whoever desires a reward in (this) world, We shall give him of it; and whoever desires a reward in the Hereafter, We shall give him thereof. And We shall reward the grateful.

**146.** 146. And many a Prophet (i.e. many from amongst the Prophets) fought (in All�h�s Cause) and along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men. But they never lost heart for that which did befall them in All�h�s Way, nor did they weaken nor degrade themselves. And All�h loves As-S�bir�n (the patient).

**147.** 147. And they said nothing but: "Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and our transgressions (in keeping our duties to You), establish our feet firmly, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk."

**148.** 148. So All�h gave them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. And All�h loves Al-Muhsin�n (the good-doers - See the footnote of V.3:134 and of V.9:120).

**149.** 149. O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers.[1]

**150.** 150. Nay, All�h is your Maul� (Patron, Lord, Helper, Protector), and He is the Best of helpers.

**151.** 151. We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they joined others in worship with All�h, for which He had sent no authority; their abode will be the Fire and how evil is the abode of the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**152.** 152. And All�h did indeed fulfil His Promise to you when you were killing them (your enemy) with His Permission; until (the moment) you lost your courage and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed after He showed you (of the booty) which you love. Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy), that He might test you. But surely, He forgave you, and All�h is Most Gracious to the believers.

**153.** 153. (And remember) when you ran away (dreadfully) without even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) was in your rear calling you back. There did All�h give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, nor for that which had befallen you. And All�h is Well-Aware of all that you do.

**154.** 154. Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ????) and thought wrongly of All�h - the thought of ignorance. They said, "Have we any part in the affair?" Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Indeed the affair belongs wholly to All�h." They hide within themselves what they dare not reveal to you, saying: "If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here." Say: "Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death," but that All�h might test what is in your breasts; and to purify [1] that which was in your hearts (sins), and All�h is All-Knower of what is in (your) breasts.

**155.** 155. Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met (i.e. the battle of Uhud), it was Shait�n (Satan) who caused them to backslide (run away from the battlefield) because of some (sins) they had earned. But All�h, indeed, has forgiven them. Surely, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.

**156.** 156. O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: "If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed," so that All�h may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is All�h that gives life and causes death. And All�h is All-Seer of what you do.

**157.** 157. And if you are killed or die in the Way of All�h, forgiveness and mercy from All�h are far better than all that they amass (of worldly wealths).

**158.** 158. And whether you die, or are killed, verily, unto All�h you shall be gathered.

**159.** 159. And by the Mercy of All�h, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (All�h�s) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in All�h, certainly, All�h loves those who put their trust (in Him).

**160.** 160. If All�h helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you? And in All�h (Alone) let believers put their trust.

**161.** 161. It is not for any Prophet to take illegally a part of booty (Ghulul ),[1] and whosoever deceives his companions as regards the booty, he shall bring forth on the Day of Resurrection that which he took (illegally). Then every person shall be paid in full what he has earned, and they shall not be dealt with unjustly.

**162.** 162. Is then one who follows (seeks) the good Pleasure of All�h (by not taking illegally a part of the booty) like the one who draws on himself the Wrath of All�h (by taking a part of the booty illegally - Ghulul)? - his abode is Hell, and worst, indeed is that destination!

**163.** 163. They are in varying grades with All�h, and All�h is All-Seer of what they do.

**164.** 164. Indeed All�h conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur��n), and purifying them (from sins by their following him), and instructing them (in) the Book (the Qur��n) and Al-Hikmah [the wisdom and the Sunnah of the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ???? (i.e. his legal ways, statements, acts of worship)], while before that they had been in manifest error.[2]

**165.** 165. (What is the matter with you?) When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: "From where does this come to us?" Say (to them), "It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds)." And All�h has power over all things.

**166.** 166. And what you suffered (of the disaster) on the day (of the battle of Uhud when) the two armies met, was by the leave of All�h, in order that He might test the believers.

**167.** 167. And that He might test the hypocrites, it was said to them: "Come, fight in the Way of All�h or (at least) defend yourselves." They said: "Had we known that fighting will take place, we would certainly have followed you." They were that day, nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. And All�h has full knowledge of what they conceal.

**168.** 168. (They are) the ones who said about their killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): "If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed." Say: "Avert death from your ownselves, if you speak the truth."

**169.** 169. Think not of those who are killed in the Way of All�h as dead. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision.

**170.** 170. They rejoice in what All�h has bestowed upon them of His Bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind (not yet martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve.

**171.** 171. They rejoice in a Grace and a Bounty from All�h, and that All�h will not waste the reward of the believers.

**172.** 172. Those who answered (the Call of) All�h and the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) after being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared All�h, there is a great reward.

**173.** 173. Those (i.e. believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said, "Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them." But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: "All�h (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us).[1]"

**174.** 174. So they returned with Grace and Bounty from All�h. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of All�h. And All�h is the Owner of Great Bounty.

**175.** 175. It is only Shait�n (Satan) that suggests to you the fear of his Auliy� [supporters and friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h and in His Messenger, Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)]; so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.

**176.** 176. And let not those grieve you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) who rush with haste to disbelieve; verily, not the least harm will they do to All�h. It is All�h�s Will to give them no portion in the Hereafter. For them there is a great torment.

**177.** 177. Verily, those who purchase disbelief at the price of Faith, not the least harm will they do to All�h. For them, there is a painful torment.

**178.** 178. And let not the disbelievers think that Our postponing of their punishment is good for them. We postpone the punishment only so that they may increase in sinfulness. And for them is a disgracing torment.

**179.** 179. All�h will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will All�h disclose to you the secrets of the Ghaib (unseen), but All�h chooses of His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in All�h and His Messengers. And if you believe and fear All�h, then for you there is a great reward.

**180.** 180. And let not those who covetously withhold of that which All�h has bestowed on them of His Bounty (Wealth) think that it is good for them (and so they do not pay the obligatory Zak�t ). Nay, it will be worse for them; the things which they covetously withheld shall be tied to their necks like a collar on the Day of Resurrection[1]. And to All�h belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth; and All�h is Well-Acquainted with all that you do.

**181.** 181. Indeed, All�h has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: "Truly, All�h is poor and we are rich!" We shall record what they have said and their killing of the Prophets unjustly, and We shall say: "Taste you the torment of the burning (Fire)."

**182.** 182. This is because of that (evil) which your hands have sent before you. And certainly, All�h is never unjust to (His) slaves.

**183.** 183. Those (Jews) who said: "Verily, All�h has taken our promise not to believe in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering which the fire (from heaven) shall devour." Say: "Verily, there came to you Messengers before me, with clear signs and even with what you speak of; why then did you kill them, if you are truthful?"

**184.** 184. Then if they reject you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), so were Messengers rejected before you, who came with Al-Bayyin�t (clear signs, proofs, evidence) and the Scripture and the Book of Enlightenment.

**185.** 185. Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing).

**186.** 186. You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in your personal selves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to All�h; but if you persevere patiently, and become Al-Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs (and that is from the great matters which you must hold on with all your efforts).

**187.** 187. (And remember) when All�h took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it, but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And indeed worst is that which they bought.

**188.** 188. Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, - think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.

**189.** 189. And to All�h belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and All�h has power over all things.

**190.** 190. Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding.

**191.** 191. Those who remember All�h (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): "Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted are You above all that they associate with You as partners). Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire.

**192.** 192. "Our Lord! Verily, whom You admit to the Fire, indeed, You have disgraced him; and never will the Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers) find any helpers.

**193.** 193. "Our Lord! Verily, we have heard the call of one (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) calling to Faith: �Believe in your Lord,� and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and expiate from us our evil deeds, and make us die (in the state of righteousness) along with Al-Abr�r (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism).

**194.** 194. "Our Lord! Grant us what You promised unto us through Your Messengers and disgrace us not on the Day of Resurrection, for You never break (Your) Promise."

**195.** 195. So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), "Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from All�h, and with All�h is the best of rewards."

**196.** 196. Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you.

**197.** 197. A brief enjoyment; then, their ultimate abode is Hell; and worst indeed is that place for rest.

**198.** 198. But, for those who fear their Lord, are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); therein are they to dwell (for ever), an entertainment from All�h; and that which is with All�h is the Best for Al-Abr�r (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism).

**199.** 199. And there are, certainly, among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), those who believe in All�h and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before All�h. They do not sell the Verses of All�h for a little price, for them is a reward with their Lord. Surely, All�h is Swift in account.

**200.** 200. O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear All�h, so that you may be successful.
