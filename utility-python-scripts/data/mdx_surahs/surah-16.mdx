# Surah 16: The Bee (An-Nahl)

**1.** 1. The Event (the Hour or the punishment of disbelievers and polytheists or the Isl�mic laws or commandments) ordained by All�h will come to pass, so seek not to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate as partners with Him.

**2.** 2. He sends down the angels with the R�h (revelation) of His Command to whom of His slaves He wills (saying): "Warn mankind that L� il�ha ill� Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so fear Me (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds).

**3.** 3. He has created the heavens and the earth with truth. High is He, Exalted above all that they associate as partners with Him.

**4.** 4. He has created man from Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge), then behold, this same (man) becomes an open opponent.

**5.** 5. And the cattle, He has created them for you; in them there is warmth (warm clothing), and numerous benefits, and of them you eat.

**6.** 6. And wherein is beauty for you, when you bring them home in the evening, and as you lead them forth to pasture in the morning.

**7.** 7. And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is full of Kindness, Most Merciful.

**8.** 8. And (He has created) horses, mules and donkeys, for you to ride and as an adornment. And He creates (other) things of which you have no knowledge.

**9.** 9. And upon All�h is the responsibility to explain the Straight Path[1]. But there are ways that turn aside (such as Paganism, Judaism and Christianity). And had He willed, He would have guided you all (mankind).

**10.** 10. He it is Who sends down water (rain) from the sky; from it you drink and from it (grows) the vegetation on which you send your cattle to pasture.

**11.** 11. With it He causes to grow for you the crops, the olives, the date-palms, the grapes, and every kind of fruit. Verily! In this is indeed an evident proof and a manifest sign for people who give thought.

**12.** 12. And He has subjected to you the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected by His Command. Surely, in this are proofs for people who understand.

**13.** 13. And whatsoever He has created for you on the earth of varying colours [and qualities from vegetation and fruits (botanical life) and from animals (zoological life)] Verily! In this is a sign for people who remember.

**14.** 14. And He it is Who has subjected the sea (to you), that you eat thereof fresh tender meat (i.e. fish), and that you bring forth out of it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships ploughing through it, that you may seek (thus) of His Bounty (by transporting the goods from place to place) and that you may be grateful.

**15.** 15. And He has affixed into the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with you; and rivers and roads, that you may guide yourselves.

**16.** 16. And landmarks (signposts during the day) and by the stars (during the night), they (mankind) guide themselves.

**17.** 17. Is then He, Who creates as one who creates not? Will you not then remember?

**18.** 18. And if you would count the favours of All�h, never could you be able to count them. Truly! All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**19.** 19. And All�h knows what you conceal and what you reveal.

**20.** 20. Those whom they (Al-Mushrik�n[1]) invoke besides All�h have not created anything, but are themselves created.

**21.** 21. (They are) dead, not alive; and they know not when they will be raised up.

**22.** 22. Your Il�h[2] (God) is One Il�h (God - All�h, none has the right to be worshipped but He). But for those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts deny (the faith in the Oneness of All�h), and they are proud.[3]

**23.** 23. Certainly, All�h knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Truly, He likes not the proud.

**24.** 24. And when it is said to them: "What is it that your Lord has sent down (unto Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???)?" They say: "Tales of the men of old!"

**25.** 25. They may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!

**26.** 26. Those before them indeed plotted, but All�h struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.

**27.** 27. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them and will say: "Where are My (so called) partners concerning whom you used to disagree and dispute (with the believers, by defying and disobeying All�h)?" Those who have been given the knowledge (about the Torment of All�h for the disbelievers) will say: "Verily! Disgrace and misery this Day are upon the disbelievers.

**28.** 28. "Those whose lives the angels take while they are doing wrong to themselves (by disbelief and by associating partners in worship with All�h and by committing all kinds of crimes and evil deeds)." Then, they will make (false) submission (saying): "We used not to do any evil." (The angels will reply): "Yes! Truly, All�h is All-Knower of what you used to do.

**29.** 29. "So enter the gates of Hell, to abide therein,[1] and indeed, what an evil abode will be for the arrogant."

**30.** 30. And (when) it is said to those who are the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2) "What is it that your Lord has sent down?" They say: "That which is good." For those who do good in this world, there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be better. And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**31.** 31. �Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity) which they will enter, under which rivers flow, they will have therein all that they wish. Thus All�h rewards the Muttaq�n (the pious - See V.2:2).

**32.** 32. Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but All�h Alone) saying (to them): Sal�mun �Alaikum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)."

**33.** 33. Do they (the disbelievers and polytheists) await but that the angels should come to them [to take away their souls (at death)], or there should come the command (i.e. the torment or the Day of Resurrection) of your Lord? Thus did those before them. And All�h wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.

**34.** 34. Then, the evil results of their deeds overtook them, and that at which they used to mock at surrounded them.

**35.** 35. And those who joined others in worship with All�h said: "If All�h had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped aught but Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without (Command from) Him." So did those before them. Then! Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey clearly the Message?

**36.** 36. And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): "Worship All�h (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) T�gh�t[1] (all false deities i.e. do not worship T�gh�t besides All�h)." Then of them were some whom All�h guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth).

**37.** 37. If you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) covet for their guidance,[2] then verily All�h guides not those whom He makes to go astray (or none can guide him whom All�h sends astray). And they will have no helpers.

**38.** 38. And they swear by All�h their strongest oaths, that All�h will not raise up him who dies. Yes, (He will raise them up), - a promise (binding) upon Him in truth, but most of mankind know not.

**39.** 39. In order that He may make manifest to them the truth of that wherein they differ, and that those who disbelieved (in Resurrection, and in the Oneness of All�h) may know that they were liars.

**40.** 40. Verily! Our Word unto a thing when We intend it, is only that We say unto it: "Be!" - and it is.[3]

**41.** 41. And as for those who emigrated for the Cause of All�h, after they had been wronged, We will certainly give them goodly residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater; if they but knew!

**42.** 42. (They are) those who remained patient (in this world for All�h�s sake), and put their trust in their Lord (All�h Alone).

**43.** 43. And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) any but men, whom We sent revelation, (to preach and invite mankind to believe in the Oneness of All�h). So ask (you, O pagans of Makkah) of those who know the Scripture [learned men of the Taur�t (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], if you know not.

**44.** 44. With clear signs and Books (We sent the Messengers). And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur��n)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought.

**45.** 45. Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that All�h will not sink them into the earth, or that the torment will not seize them from directions they perceive not?

**46.** 46. Or that He may catch them in the midst of their going to and fro (in their jobs), so that there be no escape for them (from All�h�s punishment)?

**47.** 47. Or that He may catch them with gradual wasting (of their wealth and health). Truly! Your Lord is indeed full of Kindness, Most Merciful?

**48.** 48. Have they not observed things that All�h has created: (how) their shadows incline to the right and to the left, making prostration unto All�h, and they are lowly?

**49.** 49. And to All�h prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord (All�h) with humility].

**50.** 50. They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.

**51.** 51. And All�h said (O mankind!): "Take not il�hain (two gods in worship). Verily, He (All�h) is (the) only One Il�h[1] (God). Then, fear Me (All�h ?? ?????) much [and Me (Alone), i.e. be away from all kinds of sins and evil deeds that All�h has forbidden and do all that All�h has ordained and worship none but All�h][2].

**52.** 52. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and (all that is in) the earth and Ad-D�n W�siba is His [(i.e. perpetual sincere obedience to All�h is obligatory). None has the right to be worshipped but All�h)]. Will you then fear any other than All�h?

**53.** 53. And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from All�h. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help.

**54.** 54. Then, when He has removed the harm from you, behold! some of you associate others in worship with their Lord (All�h).

**55.** 55. So (as a result of that) they deny (with ungratefulness) that (All�h�s Favours) which We have bestowed on them! Then enjoy yourselves (your short stay), but you will come to know (with regrets).

**56.** 56. And they assign a portion of that which We have provided them unto what they know not (false deities). By All�h, you shall certainly be questioned about (all) that you used to fabricate.

**57.** 57. And they assign daughters unto All�h! - Glorified (and Exalted) is He above all that they associate with Him! And unto themselves what they desire;

**58.** 58. And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward grief!

**59.** 59. He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonour or bury her in the earth[1]? Certainly, evil is their decision.

**60.** 60. For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an evil description, and for All�h is the highest description. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**61.** 61. And if All�h were to seize mankind for their wrong-doing, He would not leave on it (the earth) a single moving (living) creature, but He postpones them for an appointed term and when their term comes, neither can they delay nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment).

**62.** 62. They assign to All�h that which they dislike (for themselves), and their tongues assert the falsehood that the better things will be theirs. No doubt for them is the Fire, and they will be the first to be hastened on into it, and left there neglected. (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�)

**63.** 63. By All�h, We indeed sent (Messengers) to the nations before you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???), but Shait�n (Satan) made their deeds fair-seeming to them. So he (Satan) is their Wali (helper) today (i.e. in this world), and theirs will be a painful torment.

**64.** 64. And We have not sent down the Book (the Qur�an) to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe.

**65.** 65. And All�h sends down water (rain) from the sky, then He revives the earth therewith after its death. Verily, in this is a sign (clear proof) for people who listen (obey All�h).

**66.** 66. And verily! In the cattle, there is a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, from between excretions and blood, pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.

**67.** 67. And from the fruits of date-palms and grapes, you derive strong drink and a goodly provision. Verily, therein is indeed a sign for people who have wisdom.

**68.** 68. And your Lord inspired the bees, saying: "Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect.

**69.** 69. "Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you)." There comes forth from their bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think.

**70.** 70. And All�h has created you and then He will cause you to die; and of you there are some who are sent back to senility, so that they know nothing after having known (much). Truly! All�h is All-Knowing, All-Powerful.

**71.** 71. And All�h has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties. Then, those who are preferred will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof[1]. Do they then deny the Favour of All�h?

**72.** 72. And All�h has made for you Azw�j (mates or wives) of your own kind, and has made for you, from your wives, sons and grandsons, and has bestowed on you good provision. Do they then believe in false deities and deny the Favour of All�h (by not worshipping All�h Alone).

**73.** 73. And they worship others besides All�h - such as do not and cannot own any provision for them from the heavens or the earth.

**74.** 74. So put not forward similitudes for All�h (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! All�h knows and you know not.

**75.** 75. All�h puts forward the example of (two men - a believer and a disbeliever); a slave (disbeliever) under the possession of another, he has no power of any sort, and (the other), a man (believer) on whom We have bestowed a good provision from Us, and he spends thereof secretly and openly. Can they be equal? (By no means). All the praises and thanks are to All�h. Nay! (But) most of them know not.

**76.** 76. And All�h puts forward (another) example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything (disbeliever), and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one (believer in the Isl�mic Monotheism) who commands justice, and is himself on the Straight Path?

**77.** 77. And to All�h belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer. Truly! All�h is Able to do all things.

**78.** 78. And All�h has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing. And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts that you might give thanks (to All�h).

**79.** 79. Do they not see the birds held (flying) in the midst of the sky? None holds them but All�h [none gave them the ability to fly but All�h]. Verily, in this are clear Ay�t (proofs and signs) for people who believe (in the Oneness of All�h).

**80.** 80. And All�h has made for you in your homes an abode, and made for you out of the hides of the cattle (tents for) dwelling, which you find so light (and handy) when you travel and when you stay (in your travels); and of their wool, fur, and hair (sheep wool, camel fur, and goat hair), furnishings and articles of convenience (e.g. carpets, blankets), comfort for a while.

**81.** 81. And All�h has made for you out of that which He has created shades, and has made for you places of refuge in the mountains, and has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence. Thus does He perfect His Favour unto you, that you may submit yourselves to His Will (in Isl�m).

**82.** 82. Then, if they turn away, your duty (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) is only to convey (the Message) in a clear way.

**83.** 83. They recognise the Grace of All�h, yet they deny it (by worshipping others besides All�h) and most of them are disbelievers (deny the Prophethood of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???).

**84.** 84. And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up from each nation a witness (their Messenger), then, those who disbelieved will not be given leave (to put forward excuses), nor will they be allowed (to return to the world) to repent and ask for All�h�s Forgiveness (of their sins).

**85.** 85. And when those who did wrong (the disbelievers) will see the torment, then it will not be lightened unto them, nor will they be given respite.

**86.** 86. And when those who associated partners with All�h see their (All�h�s so-called) partners, they will say: "Our Lord! These are our partners whom we used to invoke besides you." But they will throw back their word at them (and say): "Surely! You indeed are liars!"

**87.** 87. And they will offer (their full) submission to All�h (Alone) on that Day, and their invented false deities [all that they used to invoke besides All�h, e.g. idols, saints, priests, monks, angels, jinn, Jibr�l (Gabriel), Messengers] will vanish from them.

**88.** 88. Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the Path of All�h, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption [by disobeying All�h themselves, as well as ordering others (mankind) to do so].

**89.** 89. And (remember) the Day when We shall raise up from every nation a witness against them from amongst themselves. And We shall bring you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) as a witness against these. And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur�an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to All�h as Muslims).

**90.** 90. Verily, All�h enjoins Al-�Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but All�h Alone - Isl�mic Monotheism) and Al-Ihs�n [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to All�h, totally for All�h�s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ???? in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin[1] (i.e. all that All�h has ordered you to give them e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahsh� (i.e all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e all that is prohibited by Isl�mic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.

**91.** 91. And fulfil the Covenant of All�h (Bai�ah: pledge for Isl�m) when you have covenanted, and break not the oaths after you have confirmed them - and indeed you have appointed All�h your surety. Verily! All�h knows what you do.

**92.** 92. And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong, by taking your oaths as a means of deception among yourselves, lest a nation should be more numerous than another nation. All�h only tests you by this [i.e who obeys All�h and fulfils All�h�s Covenant and who disobeys All�h and breaks All�h�s Covenant]. And on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly make clear to you that wherein you used to differ [i.e. a believer confesses and believes in the Oneness of All�h and in the Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ??? which the disbeliever denies and that is their difference amongst them in the life of this world][2].

**93.** 93. And had All�h willed, He could have made you (all) one nation, but He sends astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. But you shall certainly be called to account for what you used to do.

**94.** 94. And make not your oaths a means of deception among yourselves, lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted, and you may have to taste the evil (punishment in this world) of having hindered (men) from the Path of All�h (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of All�h and His Messenger, Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???), and yours will be a great torment (i.e. the Fire of Hell in the Hereafter).

**95.** 95. And purchase not a small gain at the cost of All�h�s Covenant. Verily! What is with All�h is better for you if you did but know.

**96.** 96. Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with All�h (of good deeds) will remain. And those who are patient, We will certainly pay them a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do[1].

**97.** 97. Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female - while he (or she) is a true believer (of Isl�mic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).

**98.** 98. So when you want to recite the Qur��n, seek refuge with All�h from Shait�n (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one).

**99.** 99. Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (All�h).

**100.** 100. His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (All�h i.e. those who are Mushrik�n i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6:121).

**101.** 101. And when We change a Verse (of the Qur��n,) in place of another - and All�h knows best what He sends down - they (the disbelievers) say: "You (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) are but a Muftari! (forger, liar)." Nay, but most of them know not.

**102.** 102. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibr�l (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Qur��n) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to All�h as Muslims).

**103.** 103. And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: "It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???)." The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur��n) is a clear Arabic tongue.

**104.** 104. Verily! Those who believe not in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h, All�h will not guide them and theirs will be a painful torment.

**105.** 105. It is only those who believe not in the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of All�h, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars.

**106.** 106. Whoever disbelieved in All�h after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from All�h, and theirs will be a great torment.

**107.** 107. That is because they loved and preferred the life of this world over that of the Hereafter. And All�h guides not the people who disbelieve.

**108.** 108. They are those upon whose hearts, hearing (ears) and sight (eyes) All�h has set a seal. And they are the heedless!

**109.** 109. No doubt, in the Hereafter, they will be the losers.

**110.** 110. Then, verily! Your Lord - for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of All�h) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward is, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**111.** 111. (Remember) the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly.

**112.** 112. And All�h puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of All�h (with ungratefulness). So All�h made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) which they (its people) used to do[1].

**113.** 113. And verily, there had come unto them a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) from among themselves, but they denied him, so the torment overtook them while they were Z�lim�n (polytheists and wrong-doers).

**114.** 114. So eat of the lawful and good food[2] which All�h has provided for you. And be grateful for the Favour of All�h, if it is He Whom you worship.

**115.** 115. He has forbidden you only Al-Maitah (meat of a dead animal), blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than All�h (or has been slaughtered for idols or on which All�h�s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, and not transgressing, - then, All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**116.** 116. And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: "This is lawful and this is forbidden," so as to invent lies against All�h. Verily, those who invent lies against All�h will never prosper.

**117.** 117. A passing brief enjoyment (will be theirs), but they will have a painful torment.

**118.** 118. And unto those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) before [see Verse 6:146]. And We wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.

**119.** 119. Then, verily! Your Lord - for those who do evil (commit sins and are disobedient to All�h) in ignorance and afterward repent and do righteous deeds, verily, your Lord thereafter, (to such) is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**120.** 120. Verily, Ibr�h�m (Abraham) was an Ummah (a leader having all the good righteous qualities), or a nation, obedient to All�h, Han�f (i.e. to worship none but All�h), and he was not one of those who were Al-Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h, and those who joined partners with All�h).

**121.** 121. (He was) thankful for His (All�h�s) Favours. He (All�h) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a Straight Path (Isl�mic Monotheism - neither Judaism nor Christianity[1]).

**122.** 122. And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous.

**123.** 123. Then, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ??? saying): "Follow the religion of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) Hanif (Isl�mic Monotheism[2] - to worship none but All�h) and he was not of the Mushrik�n (polytheists, idolaters and disbelievers).

**124.** 124. The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it, and verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ.

**125.** 125. Invite (mankind, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Isl�m) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur��n) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His Path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided.

**126.** 126. And if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of All�h), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-S�bir�n (the patient).[3]

**127.** 127. And endure you patiently (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ? ???), your patience is not but from All�h. And grieve not over them (polytheists and pagans), and be not distressed because of what they plot.

**128.** 128. Truly, All�h is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him),[4] and those who are Muhsin�n (good-doers. See the footenote of V.9:120).
