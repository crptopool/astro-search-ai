# Surah 64: The Mutual Disillusion (At-Taghabun)

**1.** 1. Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies All�h. His is the dominion, and to Him belong all the praises and thanks, and He is Able to do all things.

**2.** 2. He it is Who created you, then some of you are disbelievers and some of you are believers. And All�h is All-Seer of what you do.

**3.** 3. He has created the heavens and the earth with truth, and He shaped you and made good your shapes. And to Him is the final Return.

**4.** 4. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. And All�h is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts (of men).

**5.** 5. Has not the news reached you of those who disbelieved aforetime? And so they tasted the evil result of their disbelief, and theirs will be a painful torment.

**6.** 6. That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs (signs), but they said: "Shall mere men guide us?" So they disbelieved and turned away (from the truth). But All�h was not in need (of them). And All�h is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.

**7.** 7. The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the Account). Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of (and recompensed for) what you did; and that is easy for All�h.

**8.** 8. Therefore, believe in All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and in the Light (this Qur��n) which We have sent down. And All�h is All-Aware of what you do.

**9.** 9. (And remember) the Day when He will gather you (all) on the Day of Gathering, - that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain (i.e. loss for the disbelievers as they will enter the Hell-fire and gain for the believers as they will enter Paradise). And whosoever believes in All�h and performs righteous good deeds, He will expiate from him his sins, and will admit him to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) to dwell therein forever; that will be the great success.

**10.** 10. But those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism) and denied Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be the dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination[1].

**11.** 11. No calamity befalls, but by the Leave [i.e. Decision and Qadar (Divine Preordainments)] of All�h, and whosoever believes in All�h, He guides his heart [to the true Faith with certainty, i.e. what has befallen him was already written for him by All�h from the Qadar (Divine Preordainments)]. And All�h is the All-Knower of everything.[2]

**12.** 12. Obey All�h, and obey the Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????); but if you turn away, then the duty of Our Messenger is only to convey (the Message) clearly.

**13.** 13. All�h! L� il�ha ill� Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). And in All�h (Alone) therefore, let the believers put their trust.

**14.** 14. O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you (who may stop you from the obedience of All�h); therefore beware of them! But if you pardon (them) and overlook, and forgive (their faults), then verily All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**15.** 15. Your wealth and your children are only a trial, whereas All�h! With Him is a great reward (Paradise).

**16.** 16. So keep your duty to All�h and fear Him as much as you can; listen and obey, and spend in charity; that is better for yourselves. And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, then they are the successful ones.

**17.** 17. If you lend All�h a goodly loan (i.e. spend in All�h�s Cause), He will double it for you, and will forgive you. And All�h is Most Ready to appreciate and to reward, Most Forbearing,

**18.** 18. All-Knower of the unseen and seen, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
