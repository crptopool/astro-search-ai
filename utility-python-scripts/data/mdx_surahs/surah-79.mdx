# Surah 79: Those who drag forth (An-Nazi'at)

**1.** 1. By those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the disbelievers and the wicked) with great violence.

**2.** 2. By those (angels) who gently take out (the souls of the believers).

**3.** 3. And by those that swim along (i.e. angels or planets in their orbits).

**4.** 4. And by those that press forward as in a race (i.e. the angels or stars or the horses).

**5.** 5. And by those angels who arrange to do the Commands of their Lord, (so verily, you disbelievers will be called to account).

**6.** 6. On the Day (when the first blowing of the Trumpet is blown), the earth and the mountains will shake violently (and everybody will die).

**7.** 7. The second blowing of the Trumpet follows it (and everybody will be resurrected).

**8.** 8. (Some) hearts that Day will shake with fear and anxiety.

**9.** 9. Their eyes will be downcast.

**10.** 10. They say: "Shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state of life?

**11.** 11. "Even after we are crumbled bones?"

**12.** 12. They say: "It would in that case, be a return with loss!"

**13.** 13. But it will be only a single Zajrah [shout (i.e., the second blowing of the Trumpet)], (See Verse 37:19).

**14.** 14. When behold, they find themselves on the surface of the earth alive after their death,

**15.** 15. Has there come to you the story of M�s� (Moses)?

**16.** 16. When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of T�w�,

**17.** 17. Go to Fir�aun (Pharaoh); verily he has transgressed all bounds (in crimes, sins, polytheism, disbelief).

**18.** 18. And say to him: "Would you purify yourself (from the sin of disbelief by becoming a believer)?"

**19.** 19. "And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him?"

**20.** 20. Then [M�s� (Moses)] showed him the great sign (miracles).

**21.** 21. But [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] belied and disobeyed.

**22.** 22. Then he turned his back, striving (against All�h).

**23.** 23. Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud,

**24.** 24. Saying: "I am your lord, most high."

**25.** 25. So All�h, seized him with punishment for his last[1] and first[2] transgression. [Tafsir At-Tabari]

**26.** 26. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears All�h.

**27.** 27. Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven that He constructed?

**28.** 28. He raised its height, and has perfected it.

**29.** 29. Its night He covers with darkness and its forenoon He brings out (with light)

**30.** 30. And after that He spread the earth,

**31.** 31. And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.

**32.** 32. And the mountains He has fixed firmly,

**33.** 33. (To be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.

**34.** 34. But when there comes the greatest catastrophe (i.e. the Day of Recompense) -

**35.** 35. The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.

**36.** 36. And Hell-fire shall be made apparent in full view for (every) one who sees.

**37.** 37. Then for him who transgressed all bounds, (in disbelief, oppression and evil deeds of disobedience to All�h).

**38.** 38. And preferred the life of this world (by following his evil desires and lusts),

**39.** 39. Verily, his abode will be Hell-fire;

**40.** 40. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.

**41.** 41. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.

**42.** 42. They ask you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) about the Hour - when will be its appointed time?

**43.** 43. You have no knowledge to say anything about it.

**44.** 44. To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term thereof?

**45.** 45. You (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) are only a warner for those who fear it,

**46.** 46. The Day they see it, (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an afternoon or a morning.
