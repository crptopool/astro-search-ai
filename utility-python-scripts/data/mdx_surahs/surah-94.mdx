# Surah 94: The Relief (Ash-Sharh)

**1.** 1. Have We not opened your breast for you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)?

**2.** 2. And removed from you your burden.

**3.** 3. Which weighed down your back?

**4.** 4. And have We not raised high your fame?

**5.** 5. Verily, along with every hardship is relief,

**6.** 6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief (i.e. there is one hardship with two reliefs, so one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs).

**7.** 7. So when you have finished (your occupation), devote yourself for All�h�s worship.

**8.** 8. And to your Lord (Alone) turn (all your) intentions and hopes.
