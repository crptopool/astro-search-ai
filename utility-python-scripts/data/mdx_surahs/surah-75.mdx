# Surah 75: The Resurrection (Al-Qiyamah)

**1.** 1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection.

**2.** 2. And I swear by the self-reproaching person (a believer).

**3.** 3. Does man (a disbeliever) think that We shall not assemble his bones?

**4.** 4. Yes, We are Able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.[1]

**5.** 5. Nay! Man (denies Resurrection and Reckoning. So he) desires to continue committing sins.

**6.** 6. He asks: "When will be this Day of Resurrection?"

**7.** 7. So, when the sight shall be dazed.

**8.** 8. And the moon will be eclipsed.

**9.** 9. And the sun and moon will be joined together (by going one into the other or folded up or deprived of their light).[2]

**10.** 10. On that Day man will say: "Where (is the refuge) to flee?"

**11.** 11. No! There is no refuge!

**12.** 12. Unto your Lord (Alone) will be the place of rest that Day.

**13.** 13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward (of his evil good deeds), and what he left behind (of his good or evil traditions).

**14.** 14. Nay! Man will be a witness against himself [as his body parts (skin, hands, legs, etc.) will speak about his deeds],

**15.** 15. Though he may put forth his excuses (to cover his evil deeds).

**16.** 16. Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur��n, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) to make haste therewith.

**17.** 17. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) the ability to recite it (the Qur��n).

**18.** 18. And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? through Jibr�l (Gabriel)], then follow its (the Qur�an�s) recital.

**19.** 19. Then it is for Us (All�h) to make it clear (to you).

**20.** 20. Not [as you think, that you (mankind) will not be resurrected and recompensed for your deeds], but you (men) love the present life of this world,

**21.** 21. And neglect the Hereafter.

**22.** 22. Some faces that Day shall be N�dirah (shining and radiant).

**23.** 23. Looking at their Lord (All�h).

**24.** 24. And some faces, that Day, will be B�sirah (dark, gloomy, frowning, and sad),

**25.** 25. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.

**26.** 26. Nay, when (the soul) reaches to the collar bone (i.e. up to the throat in its exit),

**27.** 27. And it will be said: "Who can cure him (and save him from death)?"

**28.** 28. And he (the dying person) will conclude that it was (the time) of parting (death);

**29.** 29. And one leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded).[1]

**30.** 30. The drive will be, on that Day, to your Lord (All�h)!

**31.** 31. So he (the disbeliever) neither believed (in this Qur��n and in the Message of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) nor prayed!

**32.** 32. But on the contrary, he belied (this Qur��n and the Message of Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and turned away!

**33.** 33. Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!

**34.** 34. Woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!

**35.** 35. Again, woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!

**36.** 36. Does man think that he will be left neglected (without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord All�h on him)?

**37.** 37. Was he not a Nutfah (mixed male and female sexual discharge) of semen emitted (poured forth)?

**38.** 38. Then he became an �Alaqah (a clot); then (All�h) shaped and fashioned (him) in due proportion.[2]

**39.** 39. And made of him two sexes, male and female.

**40.** 40. Is not He (All�h Who does that) Able to give life to the dead? (Yes! He is Able to do all things).
