# Surah 37: Those who set the Ranks (As-Saffat)

**1.** 1. By those (angels) ranged in ranks (or rows).

**2.** 2. By those (angels) who drive the clouds in a good way.

**3.** 3. By those (angels) who bring the Book and the Qur��n from All�h to mankind [Tafsir Ibn Kath�r].

**4.** 4. Verily your Il�h (God) is indeed One (i.e. All�h):

**5.** 5. Lord of the heavens and of the earth, and all that is between them, and Lord of every point of the sun�s risings.[1]

**6.** 6. Verily We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty).[2]

**7.** 7. And to guard against every rebellious devil.

**8.** 8. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side.

**9.** 9. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment.

**10.** 10. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness.

**11.** 11. Then ask them (i.e. these polytheists, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Are they stronger as creation, or those (others like the heavens and the earth and the mountains) whom We have created?" Verily, We created them of a sticky clay.

**12.** 12. Nay, you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) wondered (at their insolence) while they mock (at you and at the Qur��n).

**13.** 13. And when they are reminded, they pay no attention.

**14.** 14. And when they see an Ay�h (a sign, or an evidence) from All�h, they mock at it.

**15.** 15. And they say: "This is nothing but evident magic!

**16.** 16. "When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected?

**17.** 17. "And also our fathers of old?"

**18.** 18. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Yes, and you shall then be humiliated."

**19.** 19. It will be a single Zajrah [shout (i.e. the second blowing of the Trumpet)], and behold, they will be staring!

**20.** 20. They will say: "Woe to us! This is the Day of Recompense!"

**21.** 21. (It will be said): "This is the Day of Judgement which you used to deny."

**22.** 22. (It will be said to the angels): "Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils) and what they used to worship,

**23.** 23. "Instead of All�h, and lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell);

**24.** 24. "But stop them, verily they are to be questioned.

**25.** 25. "What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)?"

**26.** 26. Nay, but that Day they shall surrender.

**27.** 27. And they will turn to one another and question one another.

**28.** 28. They will say: "It was you who used to come to us from the right side [i.e. from the right side of one of us and beautify for us every evil, enjoin on us polytheism, and stop us from the truth i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism and from every good deed]."

**29.** 29. They will reply: "Nay, you yourselves were not believers.

**30.** 30. "And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were T�gh�n (transgressing) people (polytheists, and disbelievers).

**31.** 31. "So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly (have to) taste (the torment).

**32.** 32. "So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray."

**33.** 33. Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment.

**34.** 34. Certainly, that is how We deal with Al-Mujrim�n (polytheists, sinners, disbelievers, criminals, the disobedient to All�h).

**35.** 35. Truly, when it was said to them: L� il�ha illall�h "(none has the right to be worshipped but All�h)," they puffed themselves up with pride[1] (i.e. denied it).

**36.** 36. And (they) said: "Are we going to abandon our �lihah (gods) for the sake of a mad poet?"

**37.** 37. Nay! he (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) has come with the truth (i.e. All�h�s religion - Isl�mic Monotheism and this Qur��n) and he confirms the Messengers (before him who brought All�h�s religion - Isl�mic Monotheism).

**38.** 38. Verily, you (pagans of Makkah) are going to taste the painful torment;

**39.** 39. And you will be requited nothing except for what you used to do (evil deeds, sins, and All�h�s disobedience which you used to do in this world)

**40.** 40. Save the chosen slaves of All�h (i.e. the true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism).

**41.** 41. For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise),

**42.** 42. Fruits; and they shall be honoured,

**43.** 43. In the Gardens of delight (Paradise),

**44.** 44. Facing one another on thrones.

**45.** 45. Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine -

**46.** 46. White, delicious to the drinkers.

**47.** 47. Neither will they have Ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, a sin) from that, nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.

**48.** 48. And beside them will be Q�sir�t-at-Tarf [chaste females (wives), restraining their glances (desiring none except their husbands)], with wide and beautiful eyes.[2]

**49.** 49. (Delicate and pure) as if they were (hidden) eggs (well) preserved.

**50.** 50. Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.

**51.** 51. A speaker of them will say: "Verily, I had a companion (in the world),

**52.** 52. Who used to say: "Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death).

**53.** 53. "(That) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?"

**54.** 54. (The speaker) said: "Will you look down?"

**55.** 55. So he looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.

**56.** 56. He said: "By All�h! You have nearly ruined me.

**57.** 57. "Had it not been for the Grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell)."

**58.** 58. (The dwellers of Paradise will say) "Are we then not to die (any more)?

**59.** 59. Except our first death, and we shall not be punished? (after we have entered Paradise)."

**60.** 60. Truly, this is the supreme success!

**61.** 61. For the like of this let the workers work.

**62.** 62. Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqq�m (a horrible tree in Hell)?

**63.** 63. Truly We have made it (as) a trail for the Z�lim�n (polytheists, disbelievers, wrong-doers).

**64.** 64. Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire,

**65.** 65. The shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of Shay�t�n (devils);

**66.** 66. Truly, they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith.

**67.** 67. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture (of boiling water and Zaqq�m in their bellies).

**68.** 68. Then thereafter, verily, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.

**69.** 69. Verily, they found their fathers on the wrong path;

**70.** 70. So they (too) hastened in their footsteps!

**71.** 71. And indeed most of the men of old went astray before them;

**72.** 72. And indeed We sent among them warners (Messengers);

**73.** 73. Then see what was the end of those who were warned (but heeded not).

**74.** 74. Except the chosen slaves of All�h (faithful, obedient, and true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism).

**75.** 75. And indeed N�h (Noah) invoked Us, and We are the Best of those who answer (the request).

**76.** 76. And We rescued him and his family from the great distress (i.e. drowning),

**77.** 77. And, his progeny, them We made the survivors (i.e. Shem, Ham and Japheth).

**78.** 78. And left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations:

**79.** 79. "Sal�m (peace) be upon N�h (Noah) (from Us) among the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!"

**80.** 80. Verily, thus We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers - See V.2:112).

**81.** 81. Verily, he [N�h (Noah)] was one of Our believing slaves.

**82.** 82. Then We drowned the others (disbelievers and polytheists).

**83.** 83. And, verily, among those who followed his [N�h�s (Noah)] way (Isl�mic Monotheism) was Ibr�h�m (Abraham).

**84.** 84. When he came to his Lord with a pure heart [attached to All�h Alone and none else, worshipping none but All�h Alone - true Isl�mic Monotheism, pure from the filth of polytheism].

**85.** 85. When he said to his father and to his people: "What is it that which you worship?

**86.** 86. "Is it a falsehood - �lihah (gods) other than All�h - that you desire?

**87.** 87. "Then what think you about the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn, and all that exists)?"

**88.** 88. Then he cast a glance at the stars,

**89.** 89. And he said: "Verily, I am sick[1] (with plague). [He did this trick to remain in their temple of idols to destroy them and not to accompany them to the pagan feast)]."

**90.** 90. So they turned away from him, and departed (for fear of the disease).

**91.** 91. Then he turned to their �lihah (gods) and said: "Will you not eat (of the offering before you)?

**92.** 92. "What is the matter with you that you speak not?"

**93.** 93. Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand.

**94.** 94. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came, towards him, hastening.

**95.** 95. He said: "Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve?

**96.** 96. "While All�h has created you and what you make!"

**97.** 97. They said: "Build for him a building (it is said that the building was like a furnace) and throw him into the blazing fire!"

**98.** 98. So they plotted a plot against him, but We made them the lowest.

**99.** 99. And he said (after his rescue from the fire): "Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me!"

**100.** 100. "My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous."

**101.** 101. So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.

**102.** 102. And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: "O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to All�h). So look what you think!" He said: "O my father! Do that which you are commanded, Insh� All�h (if All�h wills), you shall find me of As-S�bir�n (the patient)."

**103.** 103. Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will of All�h), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead for slaughtering);

**104.** 104. We called out to him: "O Abraham!

**105.** 105. You have fulfilled the dream!" Verily thus do We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers - See 2:112).

**106.** 106. Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.

**107.** 107. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (i.e. ??? - a ram);

**108.** 108. And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations.

**109.** 109. "Sal�m (peace) be upon Ibr�h�m (Abraham)!"

**110.** 110. Thus indeed do We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers - See V.2:112).

**111.** 111. Verily, he was one of Our believing slaves.

**112.** 112. And We gave him the glad tidings of Ish�q (Isaac) - a Prophet from the righteous.

**113.** 113. We blessed him and Ish�q (Isaac). And of their progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.

**114.** 114. And, indeed We gave Our Grace to M�s� (Moses) and H�r�n (Aaron).

**115.** 115. And We saved them and their people from the great distress,

**116.** 116. And helped them, so that they became the victors;

**117.** 117. And We gave them the clear Scripture;

**118.** 118. And guided them to the Right Path.

**119.** 119. And We left for them (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations.

**120.** 120. "Sal�m (peace) be upon M�sa (Moses) and H�r�n (Aaron)!"

**121.** 121. Verily, thus do We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers - See V.2:112).

**122.** 122. Verily, they were two of Our believing slaves.

**123.** 123. And verily, Iliy�s (Elias) was one of the Messengers.

**124.** 124. When he said to his people: "Will you not fear All�h?

**125.** 125. "Will you call upon Ba�l (a well known idol of his nation whom they used to worship) and forsake the Best of creators,

**126.** 126. "All�h, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?"

**127.** 127. But they denied him [Iliy�s (Elias)], so they will certainly be brought forth (to the punishment),

**128.** 128. Except the chosen slaves of All�h.

**129.** 129. And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the later generations.

**130.** 130. "Sal�m (peace) be upon Ily�s�n (Elias)!"

**131.** 131. Verily, thus do We reward the Muhsin�n (good-doers, who perform good deeds totally for All�h�s sake only - See V.2:112).

**132.** 132. Verily, he was one of Our believing slaves.

**133.** 133. And verily, L�t (Lot) was one of the Messengers.

**134.** 134. When We saved him and his family, all,

**135.** 135. Except an old woman (his wife) who was among those who remained behind.

**136.** 136. Then We destroyed the rest (the town of Sodom at the place of the Dead Sea now in Palestine).

**137.** 137. Verily, you pass by them in the morning

**138.** 138. And at night; will you not then reflect?

**139.** 139. And, verily, Y�nus (Jonah) was one of the Messengers.

**140.** 140. When he ran to the laden ship:

**141.** 141. Then he (agreed to) cast lots, and he was among the losers.

**142.** 142. Then a (big) fish swallowed him as he had done an act worthy of blame.

**143.** 143. Had he not been of them who glorify All�h,

**144.** 144. He would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection.

**145.** 145. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick,

**146.** 146. And We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.

**147.** 147. And We sent him to a hundred thousand (people) or even more.

**148.** 148. And they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while.

**149.** 149. Now ask them (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Are there (only) daughters for your Lord and sons for them?"

**150.** 150. Or did We create the angels female while they were witnesses?

**151.** 151. Verily, it is of their falsehood that they (Quraish pagans) say:

**152.** 152. "All�h has begotten [offspring - the angels being the daughters of All�h)?" And, verily, they are liars!

**153.** 153. Has He (then) chosen daughters rather than sons?

**154.** 154. What is the matter with you? How do you decide?

**155.** 155. Will you not then remember?

**156.** 156. Or is there for you a plain authority?

**157.** 157. Then bring your Book if you are truthful!

**158.** 158. And they have invented a kinship between Him and the jinn, but the jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him) (i.e. they will be called to account).

**159.** 159. Glorified be All�h! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!

**160.** 160. Except the slaves of All�h, whom He chooses (for His Mercy i.e. true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism who do not attribute false things unto All�h).

**161.** 161. So, verily you (pagans) and those whom you worship (idols)

**162.** 162. Cannot lead astray [turn away from Him (All�h) anyone of the believers],

**163.** 163. Except those who are predestined to burn in Hell!

**164.** 164. And there is not one of us (angels) but has his known place (or position);

**165.** 165. And verily, we (angels), we stand in rows (for the prayers as you Muslims stand in rows for your prayers);

**166.** 166. And verily, we (angels), indeed are those who glorify (All�h�s Praises i.e. perform prayers).

**167.** 167. And indeed they (Arab pagans) used to say:

**168.** 168. "If we had a reminder as had the men of old (before the coming of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? as a Messenger of All�h),

**169.** 169. "We would have indeed been the chosen slaves of All�h (true believers of Isl�mic Monotheism)!"

**170.** 170. But (now that the Qur��n has come) they disbelieve therein (i.e. in the Qur��n and in Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? , and all that he brought, - the Divine Revelation), so they will come to know![1]

**171.** 171. And, verily, Our Word has gone forth of old for Our slaves, the Messengers,

**172.** 172. That they verily would be made triumphant,

**173.** 173. And that Our hosts! they verily would be the victors.

**174.** 174. So turn away (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from them for a while,

**175.** 175. And watch them and they shall see (the punishment)!

**176.** 176. Do they seek to hasten on Our Torment?

**177.** 177. Then, when it descends in their courtyard (i.e. near to them), evil will be the morning for those who had been warned!

**178.** 178. So turn (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) away from them for a while,

**179.** 179. And watch and they shall see (the torment)!

**180.** 180. Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they attribute unto Him!

**181.** 181. And peace be on the Messengers!

**182.** 182. And all the praises and thanks be to All�h, Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
