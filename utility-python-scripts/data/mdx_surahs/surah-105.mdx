# Surah 105: The Elephant (Al-Fil)

**1.** 1. Have you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) not seen how your Lord dealt with the owners of the Elephant? [The Elephant army which came from Yemen under the command of Abrahah Al-Ashram intending to destroy the Ka�bah at Makkah].

**2.** 2. Did He not make their plot go astray?

**3.** 3. And He sent against them birds, in flocks,

**4.** 4. Striking them with stones of Sijj�l (baked clay).

**5.** 5. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).[2]
