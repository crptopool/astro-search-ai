# Surah 84: The Sundering (Al-Inshiqaq)

**1.** 1. When the heaven is split asunder,

**2.** 2. And listens to and obeys its Lord - and it must do so.

**3.** 3. And when the earth is stretched forth,

**4.** 4. And has cast out all that was in it and became empty.

**5.** 5. And listens to and obeys its Lord - and it must do so.

**6.** 6. O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions (good or bad), a sure returning, and you will meet (the results of your deeds which you did).

**7.** 7. Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand,

**8.** 8. He surely will receive an easy reckoning,

**9.** 9. And will return to his family in joy!

**10.** 10. But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,

**11.** 11. He will invoke (for his) destruction,

**12.** 12. And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and be made to taste its burning.

**13.** 13. Verily, he was among his people in joy!

**14.** 14. Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!

**15.** 15. Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!

**16.** 16. So I swear by the afterglow of sunset;

**17.** 17. And by the night and whatever it gathers in its darkness,

**18.** 18. And by the moon when it is at the full.

**19.** 19. You shall certainly travel from stage to stage (in this life and in the Hereafter).

**20.** 20. What is the matter with them, that they believe not?

**21.** 21. And when the Qur��n is recited to them, they fall not prostrate.

**22.** 22. Nay, those who disbelieve belie (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and whatever he brought, i.e. this Qur��n and Isl�mic Monotheism, etc.).[1]

**23.** 23. And All�h knows best what they gather (of good and bad deeds),

**24.** 24. So announce to them a painful torment.

**25.** 25. Save those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them is a reward that will never come to an end (i.e. Paradise).
