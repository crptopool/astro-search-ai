# Surah 83: The Defrauding (Al-Mutaffifin)

**1.** 1. Woe to Al-Mutaffif�n (those who give less in measure and weight).

**2.** 2. Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure,

**3.** 3. And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due.

**4.** 4. Do they not think that they will be resurrected (for reckoning),

**5.** 5. On a Great Day?

**6.** 6. The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?

**7.** 7. Nay! Truly, the Record (writing of the deeds) of the Fujj�r (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, evil-doers and the wicked) is (preserved) in Sijj�n.

**8.** 8. And what will make you know what Sijj�n is?

**9.** 9. A Register inscribed.

**10.** 10. Woe, that Day, to those who deny.

**11.** 11. Those who deny the Day of Recompense.

**12.** 12. And none can deny it except every transgressor beyond bounds, (in disbelief, oppression and disobedience to All�h) the sinner!

**13.** 13. When Our Verses (of the Qur��n) are recited to him he says: "Tales of the ancients!"

**14.** 14. Nay! But on their hearts is the R�n (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn.[1]

**15.** 15. Nay! Surely they (evil-doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.

**16.** 16. Then, verily, they will indeed enter (and taste) the burning flame of Hell.

**17.** 17. Then, it will be said to them: "This is what you used to deny!"

**18.** 18. Nay! Verily, the Record (writing of the deeds) of Al-Abr�r (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism) is (preserved) in �Illiyy�n

**19.** 19. And what will make you know what �Illiyy�n is?

**20.** 20. A Register inscribed,

**21.** 21. To which bear witness those nearest (to All�h, i.e. the angels).

**22.** 22. Verily, Al-Abr�r (the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism) will be in Delight (Paradise).

**23.** 23. On thrones, looking (at all things).

**24.** 24. You will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight.

**25.** 25. They will be given to drink of pure sealed wine.

**26.** 26. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of Musk, and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive (i.e. hasten earnestly to the obedience of Allah).

**27.** 27. It (that wine) will be mixed with Tasn�m:

**28.** 28. A spring whereof drink those nearest to All�h.

**29.** 29. Verily, (during the worldly life) those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.

**30.** 30. And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to another (in mockery).

**31.** 31. And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting;

**32.** 32. And when they saw them, they said: "Verily these have indeed gone astray!"

**33.** 33. But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as watchers over them (the believers).

**34.** 34. But this Day (the Day of Resurrection) those who believe will laugh at the disbelievers[2]

**35.** 35. On (high) thrones, looking (at all things).

**36.** 36. Are not the disbelievers paid (fully) for what they used to do?
