# Surah 88: The Overwhelming (Al-Ghashiyah)

**1.** 1. Has there come to you the narration of the overwhelming (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)?

**2.** 2. Some faces, that Day will be humiliated (in the Hell-fire, i.e. the faces of all disbelievers, Jews and Christians).[1]

**3.** 3. Labouring (hard in the worldly life by worshipping others besides All�h), weary (in the Hereafter with humility and disgrace).[2]

**4.** 4. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.

**5.** 5. They will be given to drink from a boiling spring,

**6.** 6. No food will there be for them but a poisonous thorny plant,

**7.** 7. Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.

**8.** 8. (Other) faces that Day will be joyful,

**9.** 9. Glad with their endeavour (for their good deeds which they did in this world, along with the true Faith of Isl�mic Monotheism).[3]

**10.** 10. In a lofty Paradise.

**11.** 11. Where they shall neither hear harmful speech nor falsehood.

**12.** 12. Therein will be a running spring.

**13.** 13. Therein will be thrones raised high.

**14.** 14. And cups set at hand.

**15.** 15. And cushions set in rows.

**16.** 16. And rich carpets (all) spread out.

**17.** 17. Do they not look at the camels, how they are created?

**18.** 18. And at the heaven, how it is raised?

**19.** 19. And at the mountains, how they are rooted (and fixed firm)?

**20.** 20. And at the earth, how it is outspread?

**21.** 21. So remind them (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) - you are only one who reminds.

**22.** 22. You are not a dictator over them -

**23.** 23. Save the one who turns away and disbelieves.[4]

**24.** 24. Then All�h will punish him with the greatest punishment.

**25.** 25. Verily, to Us will be their return;

**26.** 26. Then verily, for Us will be their reckoning.
