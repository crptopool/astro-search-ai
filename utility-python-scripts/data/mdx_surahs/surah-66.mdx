# Surah 66: The Prohibition (At-Tahrim)

**1.** 1. O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which All�h has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And All�h is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

**2.** 2. All�h has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And All�h is your Maul� (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All-Knower, the All-Wise.

**3.** 3. And (remember) when the Prophet (??? ???? ???? ????) disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives (Hafsah), then she told it (to another i.e. ��ishah). And All�h made it known to him; he informed part thereof and left a part. Then when he told her (Hafsah) thereof, she said: "Who told you this?" He said: "The All-Knower, the All-Aware (All�h) has told me."

**4.** 4. If you two (wives of the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ???? : ��ishah and Hafsah ??? ???? ?????) turn in repentance to All�h, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet ??? ???? ???? ???? likes); but if you help one another against him (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), then verily, All�h is his Maul� (Lord, or Master, or Protector), and Jibr�l (Gabriel), and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore, the angels are his helpers.

**5.** 5. It may be if he divorced you (all) that his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you - Muslims (who submit to All�h), believers, obedient (to All�h), turning to All�h in repentance, worshipping All�h sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants (for All�h�s sake), previously married and virgins.

**6.** 6. O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from All�h, but do that which they are commanded.

**7.** 7. (It will be said in the Hereafter) O you who disbelieve (in the Oneness of All�h - Isl�mic Monotheism)! Make no excuses this Day! You are being requited only for what you used to do.[1]

**8.** 8. O you who believe! Turn to All�h with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) - the Day that All�h will not disgrace the Prophet (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and (with their Records - Books of deeds) in their right hands. They will say: "Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us [and do not put it off till we cross over the Sir�t (a slippery bridge over the Hell) safely] and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things."[1]

**9.** 9. O Prophet (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination.[2]

**10.** 10. All�h sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of N�h (Noah) and the wife of L�t (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed them (their husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they [N�h (Noah) and L�t (Lot) ?????? ??????] availed them (their respective wives) not against All�h and it was said: "Enter the Fire along with those who enter!"

**11.** 11. And All�h has set forth an example for those who believe: the wife of Fir�aun (Pharaoh), when she said: "My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Fir�aun (Pharaoh) and his work, and save me from the people who are Z�lim�n (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in All�h).

**12.** 12. And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of �Imr�n who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our R�h [i.e. Jibr�l (Gabriel)[3]], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of All�h: "Be!" - and he was; that is ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of All�h], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Q�nit�n (i.e. obedient to All�h)[4].
