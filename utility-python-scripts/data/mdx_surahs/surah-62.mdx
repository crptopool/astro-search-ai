# Surah 62: The Congregation, Friday (Al-Jumu'ah)

**1.** 1. Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies All�h, the King (of everything), the Holy, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**2.** 2. He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book (this Qur��n, Isl�mic laws and Isl�mic jurisprudence) and Al-Hikmah (As-Sunnah: legal ways, orders, acts of worship of Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????). And verily, they had been before in manifest error;

**3.** 3. And [He has sent him (Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) also to] others among them (Muslims) who have not yet joined them (but they will come). And He (All�h) is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**4.** 4. That is the Grace of All�h, which He bestows on whom He wills. And All�h is the Owner of Mighty Grace.

**5.** 5. The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Taur�t (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example of people who deny the Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, signs, revelations) of All�h. And All�h guides not the people who are Z�lim�n(polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers).

**6.** 6. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of All�h, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful."

**7.** 7. But they will never long for it (death), because of what (deeds) their hands have sent before them! And All�h knows well the Z�lim�n (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers).

**8.** 8. Say (to them): "Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you, then you will be sent back to (All�h), the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will tell you what you used to do."

**9.** 9. O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Sal�t (prayer) on Friday (Jumu�ah prayer), come to the remembrance of All�h [Jumu�ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Sal�t (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing). That is better for you if you did but know!

**10.** 10. Then when the (Jumu�ah) Sal�t (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of All�h (by working, etc.), and remember All�h much: that you may be successful.

**11.** 11. And when they see some merchandise or some amusement [beating of Tambur (drum) etc.] they disperse headlong to it, and leave you (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) standing [while delivering Jumu�ah religious talk (Khutbah)]. Say: "That which All�h has is better than any amusement or merchandise! And All�h is the Best of providers."
