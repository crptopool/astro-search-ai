# Surah 61: The Ranks (As-Saf)

**1.** 1. Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies All�h. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

**2.** 2. O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?

**3.** 3. Most hateful it is with All�h that you say that which you do not do.

**4.** 4. Verily, All�h loves those who fight in His Cause in rows (ranks) as if they were a solid structure.[1]

**5.** 5. And (remember) when M�s� (Moses) said to his people: "O my people! Why do you annoy me while you know certainly that I am the Messenger of All�h to you? So when they turned away (from the Path of All�h), All�h turned their hearts away (from the Right Path). And All�h guides not the people who are F�siq�n (the rebellious, the disobedient to All�h).

**6.** 6. And (remember) when ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: "O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of All�h unto you, confirming the Taur�t [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.[1] But when he (Ahmad i.e. Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) came to them with clear proofs, they said: "This is plain magic."[2]

**7.** 7. And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against All�h, while he is being invited to Isl�m? And All�h guides not the people who are Z�lim�n (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers) folk.

**8.** 8. They intend to put out the Light of All�h (i.e. the Religion of Isl�m, this Qur��n, and the Prophet Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with their mouths. But All�h will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it).

**9.** 9. He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) with guidance and the religion of truth (Isl�mic Monotheism) to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though the Mushrik�n (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h and in His Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) hate (it).

**10.** 10. O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment?

**11.** 11. That you believe in All�h and His Messenger (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) and that you strive hard and fight in the Cause of All�h with your wealth and your lives: that will be better for you, if you but know!

**12.** 12. (If you do so) He will forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in �Adn (Eden) Paradise; that is indeed the great success.

**13.** 13. And also (He will give you) another (blessing) which you love, - help from All�h (against your enemies) and a near victory. And give glad tidings (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) to the believers.

**14.** 14. O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the Cause) of All�h as said ��s� (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), to the Haw�riyy�n (the disciples): "Who are my helpers (in the Cause) of All�h?" The Haw�riyy�n (the disciples) said: "We are All�h�s helpers" (i.e. we will strive in His Cause!). Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the victorious (uppermost).
