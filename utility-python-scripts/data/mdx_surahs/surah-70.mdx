# Surah 70: The Ascending Stairways (Al-Ma'arij)

**1.** 1. A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall

**2.** 2. Upon the disbelievers, which none can avert,

**3.** 3. From All�h, the Lord of the ways of ascent.

**4.** 4. The angels and the R�h [Jibr�l (Gabriel)] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years.

**5.** 5. So be patient (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), with a good patience.

**6.** 6. Verily, they see it (the torment) afar off.

**7.** 7. But We see it (quite) near.

**8.** 8. The Day that the sky will be like the boiling filth of oil, (or molten copper or silver or lead).

**9.** 9. And the mountains will be like flakes of wool.

**10.** 10. And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition),

**11.** 11. Though they shall be made to see one another [(i.e. on the Day of Resurrection), there will be none but see his father, children and relatives, but he will neither speak to them nor will ask them for any help]. The Mujrim, (criminal, sinner, disbeliever) would desire to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by his children,

**12.** 12. And his wife and his brother,

**13.** 13. And his kindred who sheltered him,

**14.** 14. And all that are in the earth, so that it might save him.[1]

**15.** 15. By no means! Verily, it will be the Fire of Hell,

**16.** 16. Taking away (burning completely) the head skin!

**17.** 17. Calling[2] (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces (from Faith) [picking and swallowing them up from that great gathering of mankind on the Day of Resurrection just as a bird picks up a food-grain from the earth with its beak and swallows it up] (Tafsir Al-Qurtub�)

**18.** 18. And collect (wealth) and hide it (from spending it in the Cause of All�h).

**19.** 19. Verily, man (disbeliever) was created very impatient;

**20.** 20. Irritable (discontented) when evil touches him;

**21.** 21. And niggardly when good touches him.

**22.** 22. Except those who are devoted to Sal�t (prayers).[3]

**23.** 23. Those who remain constant in their Sal�t (prayers);

**24.** 24. And those in whose wealth there is a recognised right

**25.** 25. For the beggar who asks, and for the unlucky who has lost his property and wealth, (and his means of living has been straitened).

**26.** 26. And those who believe in the Day of Recompense.

**27.** 27. And those who fear the torment of their Lord.

**28.** 28. Verily, the torment of their Lord is that before which none can feel secure. -

**29.** 29. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts from illegal sexual acts).[4]

**30.** 30. Except from their wives or the (women slaves) whom their right hands possess - for (then) they are not blameworthy.

**31.** 31. But whosoever seeks beyond that, then it is those who are trespassers.[5]

**32.** 32. And those who keep their trusts and covenants.

**33.** 33. And those who stand firm in their testimonies.

**34.** 34. And those who guard their Sal�t (prayers) well.[6]

**35.** 35. Such shall dwell in the Gardens (i.e. Paradise), honoured.

**36.** 36. So what is the matter with those who disbelieve that they hasten to listen from you [O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), in order to belie you and to mock at you, and at All�h�s Book (this Qur��n)].

**37.** 37. (Sitting) in groups on the right and on the left (of you, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????)?

**38.** 38. Does every man of them hope to enter the Paradise of Delight?

**39.** 39. No, that is not like that! Verily, We have created them out of that which they know!

**40.** 40. So I swear by the Lord of all the [three hundred and sixty-five (365)] points of sunrise and sunset in the east and the west that surely We are Able

**41.** 41. To replace them by (others) better than them; and We are not to be outrun.

**42.** 42. So leave them to plunge in vain talk[1] and play about, until they meet their Day which they are promised -

**43.** 43. The Day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal,

**44.** 44. With their eyes lowered in fear and humility, ignominy covering them (all over)! That is the Day which they were promised!
