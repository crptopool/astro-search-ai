# Surah 51: The Winnowing Winds (Adh-Dhariyat)

**1.** 1. By (the winds) that scatter dust.

**2.** 2. And (the clouds) that bear heavy weight of water.

**3.** 3. And (the ships) that float with ease and gentleness.

**4.** 4. And those (angels) who distribute (provisions, rain, and other blessings) by (All�h�s) Command.

**5.** 5. Verily, that which you are promised (i.e. Resurrection in the Hereafter and receiving the reward or punishment of good or bad deeds) is surely true.

**6.** 6. And verily, the Recompense is sure to happen.

**7.** 7. By the heaven full of paths,

**8.** 8. Certainly, you have different ideas (about Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and the Qur��n).

**9.** 9. Turned aside therefrom (i.e. from Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? and the Qur��n) is he who is turned aside (by the Decree and Preordainment ?????? ?????? of All�h).

**10.** 10. Cursed be the liars

**11.** 11. Who are under a cover of heedlessness (think not about the gravity of the Hereafter),

**12.** 12. They ask: "When will be the Day of Recompense?"

**13.** 13. (It will be) a Day when they will be tried (punished i.e. burnt) over the Fire!

**14.** 14. "Taste you your trial (punishment i.e. burning)! This is what you used to ask to be hastened!"

**15.** 15. Verily, the Muttaq�n (the pious. See V.2:2) will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise),

**16.** 16. Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this Muhsin�n (good-doers. See V.2:112).

**17.** 17. They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (All�h) and praying, with fear and hope].

**18.** 18. And in the hours before dawn, they were (found) asking (All�h) for forgiveness.

**19.** 19. And in their properties there was the right of the S�il (the beggar who asks) and the Mahr�m (the poor who does not ask others)[1].

**20.** 20. And on the earth are signs for those who have Faith with certainty.

**21.** 21. And also in your ownselves. Will you not then see?

**22.** 22. And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.

**23.** 23. Then by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is the truth (i.e. what has been promised to you), just as it is the truth that you can speak.

**24.** 24. Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibr�l (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibr�h�m (Abraham)?

**25.** 25. When they came in to him and said: "Sal�m, (peace be upon you)!" He answered: "Sal�m, (peace be upon you)," and said: "You are a people unknown to me."

**26.** 26. Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf [as the property of Ibr�h�m (Abraham) was mainly cows].

**27.** 27. And placed it before them, (saying): "Will you not eat?"

**28.** 28. Then he conceived fear of them (when they ate not). They said: "Fear not."[2] And they gave him glad tidings of a son having knowledge (about All�h and His religion of True Monotheism).

**29.** 29. Then his wife came forward with a loud voice: she smote her face, and said: "A barren old woman!"[3]

**30.** 30. They said: "Even so says your Lord.[4] Verily, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower."

**31.** 31. [Ibr�h�m (Abraham)] said: "Then for what purpose you have come, O Messengers?"

**32.** 32. They said: "We have been sent to a people who are Mujrim�n (polytheists, sinners, criminals, disbelievers in All�h)

**33.** 33. To send down upon them stones of baked clay.

**34.** 34. Marked by your Lord for the Musrif�n (polytheists, criminals, sinners - those who trespass All�h�s set limits in evil-doings by committing great sins).

**35.** 35. So We brought out from therein the believers.

**36.** 36. But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one [of L�t (Lot) and his two daughters].

**37.** 37. And We have left there a sign (i.e. the place of the Dead Sea[1] in Palestine) for those who fear the painful torment.

**38.** 38. And in M�s� (Moses) (too, there is a sign), when We sent him to Fir�aun (Pharaoh) with a manifest authority.

**39.** 39. But [Fir�aun (Pharaoh)] turned away (from Belief in might) along with his hosts, and said: "A sorcerer, or a madman."

**40.** 40. So We took him and his hosts, and dumped them into the sea, for he was blameworthy.

**41.** 41. And in ��d (there is also a sign) when We sent against them the barren wind;

**42.** 42. It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.

**43.** 43. And in Tham�d (there is also a sign), when they were told: "Enjoy yourselves for a while!"

**44.** 44. But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord, so the S�iqah[2] overtook them while they were looking.

**45.** 45. Then they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves.

**46.** 46. (So were) the people of N�h (Noah) before them. Verily, they were a people who were F�siq�n (rebellious, disobedient to All�h).

**47.** 47. With power did We construct the heaven. Verily, We are Able to extend the vastness of space thereof.

**48.** 48. And We have spread out the earth: how Excellent Spreader (thereof) are We!

**49.** 49. And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the Grace of All�h).

**50.** 50. So flee to All�h (from His Torment to His Mercy - Isl�mic Monotheism). Verily, I (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) am a plain warner to you from Him.[3]

**51.** 51. And set not up (or worship not) any other il�h (god) along with All�h [Glorified be He (Alone), Exalted above all that they associate as partners with Him]. Verily, I (Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) am a plain warner to you from Him.

**52.** 52. Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: "A sorcerer or a madman!"

**53.** 53. Have they (the people of the past) transmitted this saying to these (Quraish pagans)? Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds (in disbelief)!

**54.** 54. So turn away (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) from them (Quraish pagans), you are not blame-worthy (as you have conveyed All�h�s Message).

**55.** 55. And remind (by preaching the Qur��n, O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????), for verily, the reminding profits the believers.

**56.** 56. And I (All�h) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).

**57.** 57. I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures).

**58.** 58. Verily, All�h is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.

**59.** 59. And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a portion of torment like to the evil portion of torment (which came for) their likes (of old); so let them not ask Me to hasten on!

**60.** 60. Then woe to those who disbelieve (in All�h and His Oneness - Isl�mic Monotheism) from their Day which they have been promised (for their punishment).[1]
