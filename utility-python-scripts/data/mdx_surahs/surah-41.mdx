# Surah 41: Explained in Detail (Fussilat)

**1.** 1. H�-M�m.

**2.** 2. A revelation from (All�h), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

**3.** 3. A Book whereof the Verses are explained in detail - a Qur��n in Arabic for people who know.

**4.** 4. Giving glad tidings [of Paradise to the one who believes in the Oneness of All�h (i.e. Isl�mic Monotheism) and fears All�h much (abstains from all kinds of sins and evil deeds) and loves All�h much (performing all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], and warning (of punishment in the Hell-Fire to the one who disbelieves in the Oneness of All�h), but most of them turn away, so they hear not.

**5.** 5. And they say: "Our hearts are under coverings (screened) from that to which you invite us; and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a screen: so work you (on your way); verily, we are working (on our way)."

**6.** 6. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your Il�h (God) is One Il�h (God - All�h), therefore take Straight Path to Him (with true Faith - Isl�mic Monotheism) and obedience to Him, and seek forgiveness of Him. And woe to Al-Mushrik�n (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of All�h).

**7.** 7. Those who give not the Zak�t and they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.

**8.** 8. Truly, those who believe (in the Oneness of All�h, and in His Messenger Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ???? - Isl�mic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them will be an endless reward that will never stop (i.e. Paradise).

**9.** 9. Say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days? And you set up rivals (in worship) with Him? That is the Lord of the ��lam�n (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

**10.** 10. He placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers) in four Days equal (i.e. all these four days were equal in the length of time) for all those who ask (about its creation).

**11.** 11. Then He rose over (Istaw�) towards the heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: "Come both of you willingly or unwillingly." They both said: "We come willingly."

**12.** 12. Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars)[1] to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the Decree of Him the All-Mighty, the All-Knower.

**13.** 13. But if they turn away, then say (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????): "I have warned you of a S�iqah (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunderbolt) like the S�iqah which overtook ��d and Tham�d (people)."

**14.** 14. When the Messengers came to them, from before them and behind them (saying): "Worship none but All�h", they said: "If our Lord had so willed, He would surely have sent down the angels. So indeed we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent."

**15.** 15. As for ��d, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength?" See they not that All�h, Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.)!

**16.** 16. So We sent upon them a furious wind in days of evil omen (for them) that We might give them a taste of disgracing torment in this present worldly life. But surely the torment of the Hereafter will be more disgracing, and they will never be helped.

**17.** 17. And as for Tham�d, We showed and made clear to them the Path of Truth (Isl�mic Monotheism) through Our Messenger, (i.e. showed them the way of success), but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the S�iqah (a destructive awful cry, torment, hit, a thunderbolt) of disgracing torment seized them because of what they used to earn.

**18.** 18. And We saved those who believed and used to fear All�h, keep their duty to Him and avoid evil.

**19.** 19. And (remember) the Day that the enemies of All�h will be gathered to the Fire, then they will be driven [(to the Fire), former ones being withheld till their later ones will join them].

**20.** 20. Till, when they reach it (Hell-fire), their hearing (ears) and their eyes, and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.

**21.** 21. And they will say to their skins, "Why do you testify against us?" They will say: "All�h has caused us to speak as He causes all things to speak: and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return."

**22.** 22. And you have not been hiding yourselves (in the world), lest your ears, and your eyes, and your skins should testify against you; but you thought that All�h knew not much of what you were doing.

**23.** 23. And that thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to destruction; and you have become (this Day) of those utterly lost!

**24.** 24. Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please All�h, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please All�h.

**25.** 25. And We have assigned for them (devils) intimate companions (in this world), who have made fair-seeming to them, what was before them (evil deeds which they were doing in the present worldly life and disbelief in the Reckoning and the Resurrection) and what was behind them (denial of the matters in the coming life of the Hereafter as regards punishment or reward). And the Word (i.e. the torment) is justified against them as it was justified against those who were among the previous generations of jinn and men that had passed away before them. Indeed they (all) were the losers.

**26.** 26. And those who disbelieve say: "Listen not to this Qur��n, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation) that you may overcome."

**27.** 27. But surely, We shall cause those who disbelieve to taste a severe torment, and certainly, We shall requite them the worst of what they used to do.

**28.** 28. That is the recompense of the enemies of All�h: the Fire. Therein will be for them the eternal home, a (deserving) recompense for that they used to deny Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).

**29.** 29. And those who disbelieve will say: "Our Lord! Show us those among jinn and men who led us astray: that we may crush them under our feet so that they become the lowest."

**30.** 30. Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is All�h (Alone)," and then they stand firm,[1] on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): "Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!

**31.** 31. "We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask.

**32.** 32. "An entertainment from (All�h), the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

**33.** 33. And who is better in speech than he who [says: "My Lord is All�h (believes in His Oneness)," and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to All�h�s (Isl�mic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: "I am one of the Muslims."

**34.** 34. The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. All�h orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger,[2] and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.

**35.** 35. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient - and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world.

**36.** 36. And if an evil whisper from Shait�n (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) (from doing good), then seek refuge in All�h. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.

**37.** 37. And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to All�h Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.

**38.** 38. But if they are too proud[3] (to do so), then there are those who are with your Lord (angels) glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.

**39.** 39. And among His Signs (in this), that you see the earth barren; but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth (of vegetations). Verily, He Who gives it life, surely, is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed He is Able to do all things.

**40.** 40. Verily, those who turn away from Our Ay�t (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc. by attacking, distorting and denying them) are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you will. Verily He is All-Seer of what you do (this is a severe threat to the disbelievers[1]).

**41.** 41. Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder (i.e. the Qur��n) when it came to them (shall receive the punishment). And verily, it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is All�h�s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption. (See V.15:9)

**42.** 42. Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (All�h ?? ???).

**43.** 43. Nothing is said to you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) except what was said to the Messengers before you. Verily, your Lord is the Possessor of Forgiveness, and (also) the Possessor of Painful Punishment.[2]

**44.** 44. And if We had sent this as a Qur��n in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: "Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?" Say: "It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur��n) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)."

**45.** 45. And indeed We gave M�s� (Moses) the Scripture, but dispute arose therein. And had it not been for a Word that went forth before from your Lord, (the torment would have overtaken them) and the matter would have been settled between them. But truly, they are in grave doubt thereto (i.e. about the Qur��n). [Tafsir Al-Qurtubi].

**46.** 46. Whosoever does righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) his ownself; and whosoever does evil, it is against his ownself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.[3]

**47.** 47. To Him (Alone) is referred the knowledge of the Hour.[1] No fruit comes out of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor brings forth (young), except by His Knowledge. And on the Day when He will call unto them (polytheists) (saying): "Where are My (so-called) partners (whom you did invent)?" They will say: "We inform You that none of us bears witness to it (that they are Your partners)!"

**48.** 48. And those whom they used to invoke before (in this world) shall disappear from them, and they will perceive that they have no place of refuge (from All�h�s punishment).[2]

**49.** 49. Man (the disbeliever) does not get tired of asking good (things from All�h); but if an evil touches him, then he gives up all hope and is lost in despair.

**50.** 50. And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from Us, after some adversity (severe poverty or disease, etc.) has touched him, he is sure to say: "This is due to my (merit); I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely, there will be for me the best (wealth) with Him. Then, We verily, will show to the disbelievers what they have done, and We shall make them taste a severe torment.

**51.** 51. And when We show favour to man, he withdraws and turns away; but when evil touches him, then he has recourse to long supplications.

**52.** 52. Say: "Tell me, if it (the Qur��n) is from All�h, and you disbelieve in it? Who is more astray than one who is in opposition far away (from All�h�s Right Path and His obedience).

**53.** 53. We will show them Our Signs in the universe, and in their own selves, until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Qur��n) is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things?

**54.** 54. Verily they are in doubt concerning the Meeting with their Lord? (i.e. Resurrection after their death, and their return to their Lord). Verily! He it is Who is surrounding all things!
